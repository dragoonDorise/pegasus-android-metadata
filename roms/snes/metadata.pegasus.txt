description:
  The Fuma clan protects the Holy Grail which is said to possess the power to
  destroy the world. When the Koma clan attacks and steals the Holy Grail, only
  one ninja survives. Transformed into a cyborg, it is his task to retrieve the
  Holy Grail and save the world.
  .
  Hagane is an action-oriented platformer, featuring five stages, divided into
  several sub-stages, filled with lots of enemies, jumping puzzles, mid- and
  endbosses. The titular main character can perform double jumps, jump off walls,
  use four different weapons,  slide over the ground, somersault to dodge attacks
  and use several different special attacks.
  .
  Weapons include: a short sword, a chain, small bombs and throwing knives. Bombs
  and knives have limited ammunition that can be restored by picking up the right
  items dropped by defeated enemies.
  .
  Pressing and holding the shoulder buttons will cause Hagane to somersault and
  jump across the screen. This movement goes through three phases, pressing the
  jump or attack button during any of these phases lets Hagane perform different

game: Ruin Arm

publisher: Bandai Namco
description:
  "Ruin Arm" tells the story of a young boy named Arm, who lives together in Arff
  Village together with his father Borgan, his sister Linda, and the talking bird
  Lucia. Proud of the warrior traditions of their family, Borgan sends Arm to
  retrieve a powerful sword from the depths of the dungeon Arff. When Arm returns
  home, he finds the village attacked by soldiers from as hostile empire. His
  father loses his memory, and he has to find a magical herb to cure him. The king

  the computer AI handle the actions of the other characters, or control them on
  your own, one at a time. In battles, characters have their own attacks: Arm uses
  physical attacks, Linda casts magic, etc. The dungeons are complex, and many of
  them have puzzles that you can solve by making two characters co-operate.

  warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks
  and planes with gadgets attached to them.
  .
  Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head
  vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It
  features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or

description:
  Everybody has remembered waking up early on the weekend to watch Saturday
  morning cartoons. But would would happen if the cartoons were interactive? Well,
  you might end up with something like Death Valley Rally. The object is pretty
  simple: Race the Road Runner through each level as quickly as you can while
  collecting different colored flags, which are worth different amounts of points.
  When you reach the ending, if you're fast enough, you'll also get a time bonus,
  but if you're good enough, you'll get a flag bonus. Some of the flags are
  INCREDIBLY difficult to find, and the fact that you won't usually be able to
  find them, will challenge (or at least frustrate) most gamers. You can run,
  turbo run (by stocking up on bird seed), peck, and jump in this wild adventure,
  as you try to catch the escape the ever-witty Wile E. Coyote and his assorted
  ACME contraptions.

game: Doom
file: Doom (USA).zip
developer: Ocean
publisher: Ocean
description:
  The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation
  technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something
  goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell.
  Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply
  vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly
  slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back
  at the demons.
  .
  id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another
  first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective.
  Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order.
  The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is
  freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores
  of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell
  itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level.
  .
  The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of
  enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them.
  Switches and buttons must be\n
  pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will
  block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.
  .
  DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the
  levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights
  (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some
  rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas,
  pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and
  crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in
  DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the
  levels.
  .
  Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on
  Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic
  symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons),
  hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.
  .
  DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages
  and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also
  available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a
  chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a
  plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket
  launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage
  and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the
  player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the
  chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while
  taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single
  burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets,
  shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain
  gun is important.
  .
  DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra
  lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still
  available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the
  first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map
  reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret
  areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits
  allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs
  (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as
  short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.
  .
  The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion,
  plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls,
  pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying
  monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against
  one or two especially powerful creatures.
  .
  DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative
  allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while
  Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to
  collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in\n
  a random location after being killed.

  Bakutou Dodgers is a Japan-only action game for up to four players. It
  superficially resembles Hudson's Bomberman series, with its top-down grid stages
  and chaotic gameplay, but rather than leaving bombs and waiting for them to
  explode, the player can shoot energy at blocks and each other.
  .
  The goal is to sneak up behind the opponent and shoot them before they can
  reciprocate. Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed,
  which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible
  random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters
  that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a
  health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting
  hit by.

  The single-player mode involves fighting through various worlds and removing all
  enemy combatants from the field to progress.

  The Romulans request permission to enter the Neutral Zone in order to search for
  a team of their researchers that they claim has gone missing. The USS Enterprise
  is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.
  .
  Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge,
  controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.
  .
  From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set
  course to a different planet or sector. Communication:  Communicate: with other
  ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are
  orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on
  planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got
  damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the
  different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive
  orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in
  combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which
  is only possible if your current mission requires it).
  .
  Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew
  members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew
  members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members,
  Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away
  missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team
  member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected
  character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat
  and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings
  and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.
  .
  Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy
  ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields
  and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you
  can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.
  .
  While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same games, there are
  some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster
  during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it
  takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences
  and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version
  as well.

  Your spaceship is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up
  a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can

  forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight
  ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet
  hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit,
  however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and
  take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an

  and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the
  same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects
  are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will
  clear all monsters of the diamond's color.\n
  There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up
  the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one
  object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a
  monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the
  stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling
  objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.
  .
  There are 5 different modes of play: a "Round Game" in which Toad has to clear
  numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player
  mode, a "Time Race" mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.
  .
  There are some differences between the SNES and NES versions. Due to a lack of
  buttons, controls are a little different in the NES version (although all the
  moves from the SNES version are present). Also, there is no vs. mode against the
  computer, but the "Round Game" mode features two modes of play: one that
  includes boss-fights on every level ending with a 9.

  Following the events of the first Cyber Knight in the 24th century, the crew of
  the Swordfish have returned to Earth after defeating the mechanical "Berzerkers"
  far across space. However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been
  taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the
  independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that
  could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish
  and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring
  to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew
  manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the
  resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge,
  they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan
  to stop Earth's attack.
  .
  Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game,
  much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and
  areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when
  aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars,
  scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the
  crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are
  only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of
  these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which
  can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned
  in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency
  or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which
  can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks
  enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new
  weapons for them to carry.
  .
  The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person
  "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's
  hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role,
  and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When
  combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first
  strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or
  other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the
  combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen
  from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies
  in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry.
  Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that
  are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot
  and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module
  is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and
  first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options
  and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.

  In "Holy Umbrella", you control a schoolboy who lives in modern-day Japan. One
  day, the sky suddenly turns dark blue, a heavy rain falls onto the city, and the
  boy finds, halfway between his house and the school, an umbrella which seems to
  have fallen from the sky. What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical!
  The moment he touches it, he is transfered to a parallel universe. Immediately,
  he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves
  him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country
  with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the
  capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...
  .
  "Holy Umbrella" is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other
  games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero
  in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to
  townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you
  have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on
  your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character
  has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide
  through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki
  can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental
  stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies. You also find various
  power-ups and items you can equip on the hero.

developer: Human
publisher: Human
description:
  Super Fire Pro Wrestling 3 Final Bout was released in 1993. This is the first
  game ever created with contribution from Goichi Suda. Due to complaints about
  the game's difficulty, Human released "Super Fire Pro Wrestling 3 Easy Type". In
  this version there is no edit mode but all of the hidden wrestlers are unlocked.
  .
  Characters based on wrestling stars such as WWF's Hulk Hogan and WCW's Rick Rude
  are featured in the game along with Japanese professional wrestlers like
  Masahiro Chono. Each wrestler is ranked based on their attacking ability,
  defensive ability, and their running speed. An "edit mode" allows customized
  wrestlers to be created based on their wrestling type, the color of their skin,
  and a unique set of customized ring attire. A certain amount of points also have
  to be spent on developing certain attacks (and their respective defense against
  these attacks from opposing wrestlers). Digitized voices from the wrestlers and
  cheers from the audience members are included. Two of the buttons on the Super
  Famicom controller are used for strong blows while another button is used
  strictly for low blows. Sprites in the game actually show wrestlers in different
  sizes to each other (depending on height and weight). A battle royale mode
  permits four wrestlers to face off against each other simultaneously. There are
  56 different wrestlers to control; with eight playable wrestling legends.
  Referees are available and can be chosen by the player; each referee has his own
  level of strictness and essentially determine how long the match will last. It
  is possible to perform up to 300 different professional wrestling moves in the
  game.

developer: Team 17

description:
  Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms,
  aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit
  points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes,
  causing damage to everyone around.
  .
  Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from
  his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time
  limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses
  health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or
  offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player
  can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn
  ends.
  .
  There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is
  affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others
  include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and
  girders.
  .
  There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land
  and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the
  ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.

  The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over. Hikaru, Max, and Millia take
  flight to defend the earth from Zentraedi, robots, more robots, and giant space
  crab-bees. Now is the time to scramble Valkyrie again.
  .
  When starting a game or continuing the player picks from either Hikaru, Max, or
  Millia. Each flies a custom Valkyrie with its own set weapon load-out. A
  Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three
  forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots
  straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and
  the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each
  weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by
  special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the
  Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full
  stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.
  .
  In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase
  their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a
  field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will
  then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the
  player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.

  the game there are several quiz battles, where the questions mostly center
  around obscure knowledge regarding the previous title in the series, SM
  Choukyoushi Hitomi Vol. 2. Getting at least 5 out of 10 questions correct will
  force the opponent to strip and the game to progress; otherwise the protagonist
  will have her own clothes forcibly removed and the game has to be reset and

  place. A strange giant head appears in front of you, and defeats you in battle.
  When you wake up, you find out that Japan is floating in the air, and is
  attacked by a mysterious force that spawned countless demons who brought
  destruction to the cities. People are hiding among rubble and in underground
  passages. Some of them are fighting the demons, joining an organization called

  first-person 3D dungeons have a distinct Shin Megami Tensei flair. The battles
  are random and turn-based. Your main character doesn't gain levels, but instead
  accumulates energy points which can be then distributed freely to raise his
  strength, mental power, defense, etc. Certain characters join your party later
  in the game, and there are also friendly demons who would join you if you choose

  technology, CONEX is on the cusp of controlling the world. Only a hero from the
  last war can defy them and stop their plans of conquest.
  .
  Genocide 2 is a modified version of the PC release. The player takes control of
  a ten meter tall robotic ninja: the Tracer. Its only form of attack is a sword,
  but it can hold several extra weapons, and always has access to the Betty. The
  Betty can be fired in eight directions, returns to the Tracer after being fired,
  and can block enemy bullets. The objective of each stage is to reach the end,
  and some stages require you to destroy targets along the way. Any items picked
  up by the player, or damage done to the Tracer, carries over between stages, and
  each stage records your fastest time for beating them.
  .
  Aside from the visual downgrade, Genocide 2 also lost many minor enemy types and
  one mid-boss in the transition to the Super Famicom. The first stage was
  removed, and the first two levels of stage 2 were reversed. The Betty now can
  only be used for a limited time, and must recharge when its time has run out.

  are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young
  Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of
  innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is
  immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters.
  Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true
  secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...

  member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too
  long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting
  for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the

  two major sides: The Axis and The Federation.  The elite units in these wars are
  Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits.  Jake is one such

  out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be
  found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the
  gathering of "P" power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a
  variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next
  level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the

description:
  Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack
  is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.
  .
  The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which
  can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as
  possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at
  random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you
  place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area,
  he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of
  blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a
  meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear
  approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although
  the blocks that were on top of them will drop.
  .
  Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human
  player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of
  ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.
  .
  The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have
  to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in
  certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction
  with the press of a button.

  All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the
  versus mode.

  Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games
  held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the
  console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles,
  pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and
  archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics,
  or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events,
  and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow
  competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.
  .
  Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes
  compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two
  qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction
  can earn world record times.
  .
  Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely
  pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then
  set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests,
  three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex
  pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and
  good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round
  composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where
  they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition
  continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.
  .
  The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping
  events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed
  by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight
  allowed three more attempts.
  .
  Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the
  goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of
  the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to
  the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards
  and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed
  directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal
  is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for
  each.

  A sequel to Mario's Picross on the GameBoy, Mario's Super Picross features the
  same gameplay as its predecessor. The game is played slab of stone with a grid
  on it. Above of every column and next to every row are numbers that acts as
  clues as to where a filled square is located along that column or row. The point
  of the game is to find all the filled squares on the grid by using your hammer
  and chiseling out squares that you think are filled and marking those that
  aren't with X.
  .
  There are two different sets of puzzles available but you start off with only
  one, Mario's Picross, and when you completed the first level, Wario will pop in
  and offer you his set of puzzles. The difference between the two is that Mario's
  Picross have to be completed within a certain time. Every time you chisel out
  the wrong square, it will deduct time. If time runs out before you can solve the
  puzzle, it's game over. Wario's Picross are timed to see how long it will take
  you to complete it, but will not run out. The catch here is that you will not be
  notified of a wrong square.

  strange worlds. He travels throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories and
  arctic snowfields during his quest, facing down all manner of dangerous enemies
  and obstacles. He can jump and he can  launch a large fist from his stomach (he
  is a blob, after all). Further, different levels have special power-ups that
  allow the blob to assume different forms that are useful in specific
  circumstances. These include a hot air balloon (for floating up to special
  items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing blocks), a submarine (for more
  effectively navigating an undersea bonus level), a skateboard (for blazing
  through a level on a deadline), and a pogo stick (for extra high jumping). Not
  all of the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns Jelly Boy into a block
  so that he is unable to move for several seconds.
  .
  Jelly Boy collects musical notes in lieu of having a power meter. Being hit
  knocks away all of his collected notes and if he gets hit again without having
  any notes, he will lose a life. Jelly Boy also collects a variety of fruit
  throughout his quest. Accumulate enough fruit to earn extra lives. Certain types
  of fruit have other side effects (orange = more time on the clock, avocado =
  invincibility).

description:
  The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by
  the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the
  building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of
  power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or
  Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty
  battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is
  underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the
  government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the
  capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee
  from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A
  young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by
  loyal elements of the army stationed there...
  .
  Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is
  more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves
  between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player
  controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The
  wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any
  time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore.
  Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer
  cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack
  indefinitely.
  .
  Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of
  the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support
  characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for
  Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different
  weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the
  Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as
  well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer.
  Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as
  well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.

  Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a
  more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast

  In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's
  Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the
  highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches,
  tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in
  CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.

  Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western
  games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While
  it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only
  when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully
  used.

  The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself
  loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce
  Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries
  in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of
  primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.
  .
  With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the
  chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation,
  and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he
  notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs
  such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly
  increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the
  experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the
  drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the
  treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take
  revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to
  take over all computers in the world.
  .
  While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both
  cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or
  Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting
  action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after
  collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives
  protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the
  movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.
  .
  The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences
  of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional
  shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual
  World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different
  approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging
  obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to
  Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person
  and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel
  with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

  bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw
  capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow,
  Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses
  or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them
  disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM,
  where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and
  Red Virus (HARD).
  .
  For competitive players in both games, there is Mixed Match, where you and a
  friend can play Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the handicap
  levels, play time, music, and other settings to balance your different skills.
  The game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain amount of lines), DR. MARIO
  (disinfect a predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE (clear lines
  until the time expires). At the end of the time limit, the player with the
  highest score is the winner.

  In Barbie Vacation Adventure, Barbie, along with her friend Midge in two-player
  mode, travels around the country to four different vacation spots, each with its
  own set of mini games.
  .
  In Iowa, at a county fair, Barbie must catch an escaped pig by walking up to it
  and pressing the action button, after that she can play carnival games.  The
  options are a strength test, knocking down cans and a hit-the clown game.  In
  the latter two, players can  aim balls with the d-pad, then throw with the
  action button.  Leading targets is required.  The strength test has a mater that
  goes up and down and Barbie must land her hit when the indicator is on the bell
  to ring it.
  .
  In Wyoming, Barbie goes camping.  First, she must assemble her tent.  This is
  essentially a jigsaw puzzle.  Next, she must jump from rock to rock to get to
  the other side of the park where she can go on a nature hike.  In the next
  segment, players aim a camera cursor at animals as Barbie walks along the path
  and hit the action button to take photos.  This requires good reaction time.
  .
  There's a ranch in Texas where Barbie can ride horses.  The horse runs on its
  own.  The player pushes the action button to make it jump.  There are numerous
  gates on the course and the player must time jumps correctly to clear them.  If
  they hit too many, they must start over.  There is also the option to play
  horseshoes.  The cursor moves about erratically and you must press the action
  button when it passes over the stake.
  .
  In Florida, Barbie can play volleyball against Midge.  This game allows both
  players to play simultaneously in two-player mode.  Barbie and Midge can move
  forward or backward on the court and hit action to set the ball.  First one to
  ten points wins.  There is also a diving segment where barbies must navigate an
  underwater maze to collect sunken treasure. It might remind some people of
  Barbie's Ocean Discovery.
  .
  Finally, there is Barbie's home in California.  Ken has hidden presents around
  the house and Barbie must find them and identify them by shape.

  heroine of the game is a seventeen-year-old Angelique Limoges, and her main
  adversary is a rather unpleasant girl named Rosalia. Will Angelique be able to
  befriend the Guardians and become the next queen? Angelique borrows elements
  from different genres: Japanese-style adventure (without puzzles), "dating sim",
  and (not overly complex) strategy. The goal is to make sure that Angelique has
  good relationship with the Guardians, maintaining the balance. For that,
  Angelique has to visit them daily, talk to them, and see what effects their
  powers have over the land.

  Hong Kong 97, stylized as HONGKONG1997 on the game's cover, is a 1995 unlicensed
  multidirectional shooter made for the Super Famicom in disk drive format by
  HappySoft Ltd., a Japanese homebrew game company. It was designed by the
  Japanese game journalist Kowloon Kurosawa, who said the game was made in two
  days. The game has gained a cult following in Japan and Taiwan for its
  notoriously poor quality, considered to be a kusoge. The game is set around the
  transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. People from the Chinese Mainland
  started immigrating to Hong Kong and greatly increased the crime rate. As a
  countermeasure, Chin (Jackie Chan in his Wheels on Meals appearance), an
  unspecified relative of Bruce Lee, was hired by the Hong Kong government
  (represented by Chris Patten) to wipe out all 1.2 billion people in China. But
  meanwhile, in China, research was underway to bring the dead Tong Shau Ping
  (Deng Xiaoping) back to life as the "ultimate weapon". When the game was
  released in 1995, Deng Xiaoping, said to be dead in the game, was still alive.
  However, he did die months before the handover in 1997, which is when the game's
  plot actually takes place

description:
  Set partly in modern-day world and partly in a fantasy medieval Japan, the game
  is based on the manga/animé series Madara. Loosely connected to Buddhist and
  local Japanese myths, it tells the story of Madara, the son of the evil Emperor
  Miroku. An ancient prophecy said that a young warrior with tremendous powers
  will dethrone Miroku, and for fear of his son's might he ordered to cut his body
  into eight pieces. Raised with artificial limbs, Madara soon discovered his true
  origin and   understood he was destined to bring down his father.
  .
  The game puts you in the role of a teenager named Kamishiro, who lives in
  modern-day Japan. One day he and his girlfriend Subaru venture into a mysterious
  shrine on the outskirts of their home town, and Kamishiro met the princess
  Sakuya, who explained to him that he must travel to a different world and to
  help Madara to get rid of Miroku. During his travels Kamishiro meets many
  characters from the original manga story, including Madara's brother and rival,
  Kage-Ou, and discovers the secret connection between the two worlds.
  .
  The game is a console-style RPG with random battles. The combat system is
  turn-based, but the battles are set in auto mode, and you must pause them in
  order to assign commands to your characters. The battles are viewed from a
  dynamic third-person perspective, and the characters move around the battle
  field when executing their attacks. You can also change formation of your party,
  and use a variety of magic spells.

  You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To

  vermin who worship that other god.
  .
  Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the
  wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To
  get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to
  build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be,
  so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing
  the same.
  .
  When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a
  hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength
  from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he
  gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will
  burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

  But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other
  tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering
  powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their
  best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who
  didn't build on high-ground.

  success.\n
  The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly

  You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is
  limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement
  GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces
  of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along
  thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.

  Jaxon decides to rebel and steal Sküljagger's magical sword. Now he must fight
  for his life and ultimately to free the Westican people.
  .
  Sküljagger: Revolt of the Westicans is a sidescrolling platform game. Players
  select between a 1 player game, an alternating turn 2 player game or Bubblegum
  Practice. The player controls Storm Jaxon who is able to run left and right,
  jump and swing Sküljagger's magic sword. Storm must reach the end of each level
  before time runs out or risk losing a life. Under normal circumstances, touching
  an enemy or projectile will cause him to die, though the sword is often able to
  destroy projectiles. By collecting red jewels, Storm is able to both augment the
  sword with a projectile attack and be protected from one enemy attack. Green
  jewels will also protect from one enemy attack, however collecting 25 of them
  will grant an extra life. Blue jewels add additional time for Storm to complete
  each level. Finding a mask will make Storm invulnerable for a short time. These
  power-ups are either floating in the air of each level or hidden away in chests,
  boxes, rocks and coconuts. However these items which may hide items can also be
  picked up and thrown at enemies.
  .
  In addition to the power-ups listed above, fruity bubblegum can also be found.
  Only one bubble gum flavor can be carried at a time and it will be held until
  the player activates it. Grape bubblegum encases Storm in a giant invulnerable
  bubble that can bounce higher than jumping alone. Cherry bubblegum will require
  the player to inflate manually, but will allow Storm to fly. Beware as over
  inflating the bubble will pop it. Watermelon bubblegum will turn Storm into a
  projectile that damages anything on the screen, also gathering items. Orange
  bubblegum will let Storm spit out pellets at enemies which will destroy them.
  Bubblegum power-ups can be tested in the special bubblegum practice option of
  the menu.

  Corporation. These cars are usually battery-powered and are greatly scaled down
  versions of real vehicles. Shining Scorpion is the first Super Famicom game to
  use the license, but the third to appear on a Nintendo console.

  Mini Yonku toyline in mind. This serial manga features two brothers, Retsu and
  Go, who get involved in the world of Mini Yonku racing when the inventor Dr.
  Tsuchiya gives them two powerful prototype models. Let's & Go would also be the
  basis for this game's follow-up, the 1998 SFC game Mini-Yonku Let's & Go!! Power

developer: Rumic Soft
publisher: Rumic Soft
description:
  The game involves falling blocks of hands displaying the rock, paper, and
  scissors signs, which fall three at a time. In a similar manner to Tetris, the
  player can rotate the blocks to stack them, using pieces that defeat other
  pieces (e.g. paper over rock) to eliminate stacks. Doing so adds garbage pieces
  onto the opponent's screen to make it more difficult for them to eliminate their
  stacks of blocks. The objective is to fill up the opponent's screen up with
  blocks so that additional ones can no longer fit. Each character has two special
  attacks which can be used when large combinations are completed. Once in each
  round each player can also use a bucket of water that can transform a cursed
  character into their alternate form, which weakens their attacks until the
  effect wears off. This does not affect Akane or the Gambling King.

  only), Fighting Mode (2-Player) and Trial Mode (a survival mode for 1-Player
  only).
  .
  During Story Mode, the goal is to defeat all the 4 Zords, the 4 villains up to
  Lord Zedd and last, but not least, Ivan Ooze. In this mode, you can opt by the
  Thunder Megazord (formed by the 5 original Rangers) or by the Mega Tigerzord
  (formed in conjunction with the White Ranger). The Fighting Mode is an
  traditional 2-Player head-to-head combat, where you can choose any of the 4
  Zords or even the 4 villains. Trial Mode is a Endurance-like option, and the
  main goal is to win as many battles as possible using only 1 health bar (that
  will be partially replenished after each battle).
  .
  As well as many fighting games, you can take advantage of a Power Bar (here, it
  fills automatically): if you execute a Super Move when this bar is flashing, it
  will be cause more damage, besides increasing 1 level. Once you having reached
  its maximum status, it's possible to execute power-up versions of Special Moves
  or even unleash high-damage blows (Super Moves).

  throughout a level, such as a flamethrower or a laser gun. While the normal gun
  has an infinite amount of bullets, the other types of weapons will eventually
  run out of ammo. With these weapons, the player can shoot either straight, up,
  or on a diagonal. The player will also have the opportunity to commandeer a
  vehicle, which they can also fire bullets from.
  .
  The player starts with 5 lives and 3 continues. Each of the stages must be
  defeated in a certain amount of time or the player loses one of those lives.

description:
  You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather
  inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies
  that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he
  lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now,
  you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for
  your friend.
  .
  Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from
  the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates,
  and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place
  inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend
  doggie.
  .
  The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in
  a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one
  that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently.
  Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you
  cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't
  expect much, but to retry the level.
  .
  Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example,
  the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and
  push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you
  cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue
  falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other
  brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue
  spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other
  brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that
  place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not,
  the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.
  .
  Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the
  position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant
  is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or
  joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level
  in a hurry.

  classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but

description:
  Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where
  players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds
  against different boxers to win the championship title belt.
  .
  Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the
  shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming
  punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross,
  but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.
  .
  By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available,
  inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of
  three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over
  (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a
  single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch
  buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an
  energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and
  during intermissions, some energy is restored.
  .
  All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A
  password system is used to save the progress.

  shooting them. The final part ends the day with a showdown. The showdown
  involves a one on one duel in which a draw icon will randomly pop up anywhere on
  the screen which must be shot then immediately afterwards the enemy the player
  is facing then must also be shot. This continues on until either the player's or
  the enemy's life bar is drained.

  appear. The bonus screen shows a woman spinning around on a round board with
  stars next to her body. Shooting the stars without missing and without
  accidentally shooting the woman will help players pick up large amounts of
  money.

  responsible father and guardian you'll first need to find the puppy, avoiding
  dangers such as bad-tempered cats, mean dogcatchers, acorns which have a habit
  to drop down just when you pass underneath, and careless skateboarders. You can
  bark at these opponents to scare them away. And if you'll find a source of water
  (such as a rubber hose), you can make yourself wet and then - in a tense
  situation - shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the vicinity.
  .
  Once you find your pup, you'll find out that getting him back to his mom is no
  easy task. While your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own accord when you
  put him down, you'll still have to carry it over obstacles, and you'll be forced

  quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set
  pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and
  then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be

description:
  Trials of Mana is set in the same world as the two previous Mana games (Final
  Fantasy Adventure, and Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the
  center of all events in Trials of Mana. Years have passed, and all the
  destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight
  seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those
  sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but
  for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and
  which can be saved only by the legendary powers.
  .
  The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common
  background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of
  three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter,
  Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Charlotte the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler
  and Hawkeye the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and
  dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different
  characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected
  into a whole.

  Trials of Mana, like the previous game in the series, is an action RPG with real

  aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively
  played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a
  very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played
  or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the
  possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the
  played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those
  changes.

  Restoring the lands from evil, saving the princess, and finding a way back home
  might not be the most original of goals, but how many games also include the
  comedy stylings of Japanese performance group Dachou Club? Not many, that's for
  sure!
  .
  Zig Zag Cat is an unusual fusion of Breakout and a scrolling shooter. During
  action stages the player's avatar walks forward while attempting to keep their
  cat from bouncing off the bottom of the screen. The cat can break most obstacles
  by hitting them, and all obstacles will be broken if they collide with the
  avatar. By breaking blocks money and temporary paddle upgrades can be uncovered,
  such as ones that increase the size or the paddle, let you fire bullets, or
  allow you to curve the cat while it is moving. Several times during each stage a
  black octopus block will appear, and it must be destroyed by the cat before the
  player's avatar will continue moving forward. While the avatar is totally
  unharmed from walking through any enemies or blocks, some enemies and all bosses
  have the ability to fire projectiles at him which do cause damage, and if all
  health is lost from projectiles then a life will be lost just as if the cat had
  fallen off the screen.
  .
  In between action stages the player will enter an Inn. At the Inn he can save,
  talk to the locals, play a bonus board to earn additional money, buy temporary
  paddle upgrades, and check his progress on his trip around the island.

description:
  In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon
  World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After
  examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise
  White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and
  that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember
  anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen,
  she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has
  left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon
  to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil
  curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in
  their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World -
  to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...
  .
  The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his
  party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The
  battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other
  party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions
  in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for
  your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself
  strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and
  assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.

description:
  The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant
  plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their
  own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus
  and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10
  levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman
  from the 12 pieces.
  .
  Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in
  use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is
  perhaps the best option for first-time players.
  .
  The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards)
  and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to
  produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various
  methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who
  can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their
  exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any
  combination of skills and experiment.
  .
  Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible,
  rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60
  Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe -
  Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the
  hope of saving more Lems.
  .
  Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you
  have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your
  progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

  What do you get if you cross Sonic the Hedgehog with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater?
  .
  It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of
  the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers
  mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.
  .
  The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to
  B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic,
  but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating
  obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...
  .
  Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase
  your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.
  .
  Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels
  require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These
  levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.
  .
  Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them.
  Much the same could be said about Uniracers...

description:
  Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of
  pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many
  of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are
  seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners
  rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the
  flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered
  from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece
  can't flow into, the pipe is finished.
  .
  Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position,
  the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down
  anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and
  complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled.
  Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it
  easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.
  .
  Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5
  cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen.
  Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the
  side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After
  every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only
  place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board
  game of "Connect 4".

  Overview
  .
  Unleash your mahjong power!!!\n
  Jantoushi Doraou is a simple mahjong game for the Super Famicom. It features a
  wide variety of strange and ridiculous characters and is largely comical in
  nature. It follows typical Japanese mahjong rules, although there are a few
  exceptions (mentioned below). Many characters are also capable of performing
  special attacks when their "cosmo" meter is full; these attacks can have many
  different incarnations, from simply beating the opponent unconscious for a win
  (surprisingly ineffective) to instantly getting a ron. The game also features a
  password feature which allows players to save their progress.
  .
  Story
  .
  The player assumes the role of the titular Jantoushi Doraou, a master mahjong
  Saint who resides in Sanctuary and is committed to protecting the goddess
  Atenaide. Unfortunately, the villainous Mahjong warlock Jankou invades Sanctuary
  and seemingly kidnaps Atenaide! It's Doraou's duty to rescue her from the
  clutches of this fiend, and he sets off on a journey to gather the other Mahjong
  Saints and journey to Jankou's castle to rescue her. This journey winds through
  a number of towers with guardians based on the Chinese Zodiac; this is a direct
  parody of Saint Seiya, where the Gold Saints are based off of the Greco-Roman
  zodiac.

developer: Koei
publisher: Koei
description:
  In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the
  nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would
  often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming
  the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious
  Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the
  role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.
  .
  Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in
  different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three
  Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a
  larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is
  rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and
  IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game.
  The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes
  increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.
  .
  During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands
  from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying
  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe
  & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the
  defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each
  player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move,
  bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them
  into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of
  enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

developer: Titus
publisher: Titus
description:
  Your name is Kevin Codner – rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the
  distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your
  little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need
  your keen oversight and "shipsmarts".
  .
  In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers)
  as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level.
  Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the
  level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and
  bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a
  crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the
  wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to
  their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually
  choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.
  .
  There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with
  throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult,
  involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam
  from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack
  crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other
  to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually
  done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.
  .
  Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a
  certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and
  lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the
  compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers
  will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of
  time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some
  assistance.
  .
  At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that
  you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress
  through them all from the get-go.

  Street Combat is a one-on-one 2D fighting game in which several martial artists,
  athletes and crime-fighters from all across the globe decide to compete against
  each other in a street fighting tournament for fame and glory.
  .
  Single player mode allows you to choose between two versions of the "hero"
  character (Steven) and then takes you through 7 best 2-out-of-3 matches against
  a collection of different martial artists. A 2-player Vs mode allows you to
  freely select any of the characters without restrictions.
  .
  Gameplay is similar to other one-on-one beat 'em ups, in which you control your
  characters movements and attacks in a scrolling 2D plane attempting to defeat
  your opponent with special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) and
  avoid his attacks.

game: On the Ball
file: On the Ball (USA).zip
developer: Taito
publisher: Taito
description:
  There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through
  which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity
  and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the
  obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a
  fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly
  influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward
  a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board
  around the ball.
  .
  That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball
  toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of
  the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to
  further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward
  each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well
  have been named "inertia."  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be
  engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved
  to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off
  like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the
  ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress,
  touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some
  blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed
  to take the scenic detour and collect them.
  .
  It may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a
  technical demo of the SNES' Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities,
  but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an
  arcade release of this game.
  .
  (Now if only someone could explain the "Camel" part - referencing the Japanese
  title.)

developer: ASCII Corporation
publisher: ASCII Corporation
description:
  Three-hundred years ago, there were two kingdoms on the earth -Reyfore, ruled by
  the benevolent and mighty king Reynard, and Amugnon, ruled by king Daruk. The
  two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he
  didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by
  the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was
  embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged
  battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once
  again.
  .
  But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls
  down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is
  saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house.
  But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills
  the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king
  Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.
  .
  The game has a less linear structure than a standard console-style RPG: together
  with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not
  obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the
  beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his
  three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same
  screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely
  around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions
  depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is
  menu-based.

description:
  Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second
  installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a
  ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from
  left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a
  single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade.
  The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different
  names and functions for their upgrades.
  .
  In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different
  characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:
  .
  1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius
  .
  2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at
  least one Goemon
  .
  3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee
  is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching
  glove
  .
  4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a
  previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own
  games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure
  .
  5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on
  top of a missile
  .
  6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head
  and on his underside
  .
  7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his
  head
  .
  8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more
  'normal' characters
  .
  9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior
  equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his
  appearance in Parodius
  .
  10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character
  retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat
  .
  11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of
  Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this
  crazy shooter
  .
  In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a
  strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's
  not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or
  chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.

  train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style:
  reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his
  dexterity, and so on. By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him
  understand what should be done and what not.

  Olivia's Mystery is a puzzle game. It features a story, told with scrolling

  .
  The game's puzzles resemble normal jigsaw puzzles: the player has to take
  several pieces, often flipping them vertically or horizontally, and place them
  in their correct locations on a grid. The complication is that the image is
  animating in a constant loop. Often, this provides a hint as to the correct
  orientation of the piece (if a figure is climbing a wall, for instance, all the
  wall pieces should be scrolling downwards), but is often used by the game to be
  disorienting.

  second and the third "mainstream" Farland Story games, 20 years after Arc has
  become a king. Peace has returned to the world, but on the continent of Ionia,
  an emperor is plotting an evil scheme. His son Riad refuses to accept the
  methods of his father, especially when he wants to use Serena, a girl he loves,
  for his plans of war and conquest. During a quarrel, Riad attacks the emperor's
  minister, and is forced to flee the castle together with Serena. The adventure
  of the runaway prince begins...
  .
  Graphically and gameplay-wise, the game is similar to other Farland Story games,
  although its setting is generally more dark. The game consists of large
  strategic battles, during which you move your party over the battle location,
  attacking enemies physically when they are in range of your weapons, and casting
  healing and offensive magic. Like in other Farland Story games, the death of the

  Chinhai is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and a variant on Mahjong
  Solitaire, or Shanghai. Instead of pairing and removing any two tiles that match
  as long as one of their sides is clear, as is the case in Shanghai, the rules of
  Chinhai require that the two tiles can only be removed if it's possible to draw
  a line between the two that doesn't make a 90 degree turn more than twice. Two
  tiles on opposite sides of the board, for instance, can't be paired because it
  would take three 90 degree turns to draw a line between them. To account for
  this added difficulty, the game lacks the "stacks" of tiles that frequently
  appear in Shanghai, instead presenting a flat board of tiles.Chinhai is named
  for the municipality of Chinhai in China, maintaining the theme of naming
  mahjong solitaire variants after territories in China. Chinhai has long since
  been renamed Zhenhai, which is situated in the Ningpo Prefecture and now part of
  a much larger city. This mahjong solitaire variant is perhaps best known as
  Sichuan or Shisenshou, also named for a province in China.

  Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3 is the third major game in the Powerful Pro
  series. This game was released on February 29, 1996 for the Super Famicom only
  in Japan by Konami. The game was developed by Diamond Head, a developer behind
  many Jikkyou Powerful Pro games. Powerful Pro 3 is a traditional baseball
  simulator, in the "super deformed" or "chibi" style that makes the franchise
  well-known.
  .
  The game is fairly similar to its predecessors, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94
  and Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2, although it does add some new features, such
  as Success Mode. Success Mode is an RPG-esque mode where players develop a
  baseball player, guiding them through situations and forming them into a
  "powerful pro."
  .
  The real draw of the Powerful Pro series is the Success Mode, which was started
  with this game. It puts the player in control of a pre-made character who the
  player must develop into a powerful athlete. This is done by guiding the player
  through situations, making decisions, etc. As a more "role-playing game"-esque
  part of the game, this actually provides players with multiple save slots and
  options.

  The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for
  animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There
  are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama
  himself.
  .
  Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of
  levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters.
  Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island,
  fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown.
  .
  During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks
  on him/her, or use a "taunt" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle
  lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu);
  once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If
  the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a
  continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent.
  Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different
  depending on the character you have chosen.
  .
  Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the
  opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled
  opponent or another human player.
  .
  The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of
  Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.

  In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new
  one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this
  feature, though.

  Shuushoku Game (or SG: Trendy Drama) is a Japan-exclusive video game based

  adults and is based around normal human issues such as love, family problems,

  To find a game that takes it as literally as this game does is harder to come by

  Drama sub-culture during the shift in its popularity from the mid eighties to
  early nineties when Japan was experiencing a "bubble economy".

  In this game, the player is part of a young team of white-collar Japanese
  workers and entrepreneurs in training who act as the player character's friends,
  rivals, and love interests, the main of which are in their early-to-mid
  twenties. The game ranges from doing everyday things such as hanging out with
  friends and grabbing drinks at the local bar to traveling to other cities,
  meeting bigwig business men with whom the player must make business proposals,
  and monitoring the business giants and making important business decisions to
  remain competitive. Despite the sound of it, the game isn't overly complex (and
  the ability to save between most events makes things easier).

developer: Nintendo

description:
  A Tetris-like puzzle game. There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial,
  Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must
  sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or
  vertically. The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed
  from play. Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any
  two of the following types:
  .
  Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it.
  Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or
  vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the
  score.
  .
  Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster,
  Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match
  two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two
  character blocks will also be cleared.
  .
  Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb
  will explode, removing all blocks in the same row.
  .
  Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen.
  Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be
  removed in the normal way.
  .
  The game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks
  which then clear other blocks. If you clear two or more blocks in this manner,
  then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can
  fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even
  further.

  May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.
  .
  A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to
  open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push
  objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the
  stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create
  magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop
  after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next
  to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space.
  Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often
  necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired
  position.
  .
  As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and
  enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes
  be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more
  complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May,
  ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone
  if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once,
  rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.

  These abilities include cream pies, time bombs, sticks of dynamite and other fun

game: Super Star Wars : The Empire Strikes Back
file: Super Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back (USA) (Rev 1).zip
developer: JVC
publisher: JVC
description:
  The sequel to  Super Star Wars is, as the name implies, based on Episode V: The
  Empire Strikes Back, the second of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The
  game features familiar locations and events from the film, such as the ice
  planet Hoth, the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, and the fight
  against Darth Vader. Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss
  enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are
  omitted or changed.
  .
  As in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke
  Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been
  given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through
  enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his
  lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game,
  mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle
  levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against
  encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid
  field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in Luke's X-Wing fighter.
  .
  The game's other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for
  Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a
  second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups
  include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that
  restore Luke's Force power. Passwords have also been added, and are given upon
  completion of each of the game's 25 stages.

  An alien race named Kyllen has enslaved humanity. On the planet Joyec, rebels
  managed to take the Kyllen by surprise and seize one of their battle fleets. The
  player must now guide their efforts in trying to throw over the Kyllen.
  .
  War 3010 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a
  grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or
  Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also
  divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range
  combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following
  actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information,
  unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including
  those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an
  attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will
  always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it
  becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as
  take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into
  the next mission however.

description:
  Waratte Iitomo! Tamolympic ("It's OK to Laugh! Tamolympic") is a party mini-game
  collection based on the Japanese TV show of the same name. The show was a daily
  hour-long comedy variety show featuring recurring guests and various skits and
  interviews, hosted by the shades-wearing comedian Tamori (whose real name is
  Kazuyoshi Morita). It aired from 1982-2014 and made several longevity records in
  the process.
  .
  The game allows for up to four players, but only two players ever play at once:
  most of the mini-games are based on completing a task within a set time or with
  a certain amount of precision, so all players don't need to play simultaneously.
  Instead, the first pair of players will play each mini-game, followed by the
  second pair (or two-and-one, if the three-player mode was selected). These
  mini-games have a comedic edge to them and vary from bowling with a snooker cue
  to a Simon Says game that involves clapping the correct way to certain goofy
  poses Tamori makes.
  .
  Due to the license, the game was never released outside of Japan.

  live. The Yoshis decided to carry baby Mario and to bring him to his parents.
  But Kamek has sent troops and hordes of monsters to stop the Yoshis and to
  kidnap Mario.
  .
  In the game, players control the differently colored Yoshis most of the time.
  Mario is a helpless baby unless a star that makes him invincible is collected.
  As a Yoshi, players can swallow enemies to make eggs; these eggs are used for
  attacking other enemies and activating switches. Yoshi can do a flutter jump to
  clear large gaps that a regular jump can't. Players can also pound the ground
  for attacks and also flipping certain switches. Additionally, Yoshis can
  transform into vehicles, such as a helicopter, submarine, or a train. If Mario
  is dismounted from a Yoshi, a countdown will start, and Yoshi must catch the
  baby before Kamek's servants kidnap it. When Mario is invincible, he doesn't
  ride on Yoshi and is immune to attack. While invincible, Mario can run up

  .
  While following the same story as the Laserdisc conversions, the SNES version of
  Space Ace obviously lacks the long video sequences of the original, and also
  features different gameplay.
  .
  Instead of only pushing the right button at the right moment, the player has
  complete control over Dexter. Most of the time, he will be busy jumping over
  chasms and dodging alien attacks, but occasionally, an 'energize'-symbol will
  appear which, by pressing the correct button in time, will temporarily transform
  Dexter into his stronger alter ego and enable him to shoot at his enemies.
  .
  Once he boards his space ship, Dexter has to find his way out of a labyrinthine
  seen from a top-down perspective, destroying obstacles with the ship's laser and
  avoiding collisions.
  .
  In order to retain the atmosphere of the original, the SNES version features a
  large number of (short) death animations and the platformer levels always follow
  the exact same sequence, which results in a trial&error-style gameplay somewhat
  similar to the original.

  Popeye Ijiwaru Majo: Sea Hag no Maki ("Popeye and the Harassing Witch Sea Hag")
  is a Popeye platformer-action game from Technos Japan. After Popeye trounces his
  nemesis the Sea Hag, she gets her revenge by separating all of Popeye's friends
  from their lifeforce, causing them to turn to stone. Popeye has to recover all
  their life energy (in the form of hearts) from a board game-like grid while
  avoiding the various heavies that have been sent to deter him, including his
  rival Bluto who is hoping to win Olive Oyl's heart by rescuing her first.
  .
  Each stage takes place in a grid, and Popeye moves around by rolling a die and
  moving one to six spaces around the board. Some tiles allow him to purchase
  upgrades, recover health, move to other map squares and play through small
  platforming sequences. Occasionally, Popeye can bump into moving enemies on the
  map (similar to the overworld enemies in Super Mario Bros. 3) and fight a quick
  one-on-one battle with them for bonuses. His goal is to land on every square
  with a heart on it and find the heart in the stage somewhere. By collecting them
  all, Popeye saves a friend and moves onto the next board.
  .
  The game was released only in Japan for the Super Famicom.

description:
  J-League Excite Stage '96 is a Soccer game. The game offers different modes of
  play (tournaments, championships ...) although unfortunately only the few
  Japanese teams of the J League are available. It is possible to adjust the
  referee's severity and climatic conditions. It is the third of A-Max's Excite
  Stage games to be released on the Super Famicom, and also the last. However, the
  series would persist on the Nintendo Game Boy Color and Sony PlayStation. The
  game focuses on the 1996 season of the J-League with its sixteen teams, with
  options to recreate the league or play exhibition matches or tournaments with
  any of the sixteen. Like its predecessors, the game uses a horizontal
  perspective of the pitch that is slightly angled to make it easier to determine
  the distance between players. It creates this effect through the Super Famicom's
  Mode 7 scaling technology.

  STORY\n
  The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British
  Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise
  taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the
  New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the
  Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New
  World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists.
  This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts
  the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).
  .
  GAMEPLAY\n
  Choosing Sides\n
  In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American Revolutionary War, either as
  the "rebels" - the American Continental Army or as the "Crown" - the British
  Royal Army.
  .
  Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you to choose the leading
  Commander-in-Chief:
  .
  The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or George Washington.\n
  The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage or William Howe.
  .
  Revolutionary Politics\n
  Each turn you will have to balance your treasury for the war effort. Money is
  provided by each state. The more states that support your cause, the more money
  will flow in your coffers. Money is spent in paying wages, strengthening the
  fleet and recruiting new regiments.
  .
  Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also command your Navy officer to
  "control the seas" which is conducting a blockade and privateering against enemy
  ships. This may result in seized goods that will be added to your treasury.
  .
  The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death included everyone except the
  American Indians: [1] Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not yet
  fully supportive of Continental Army (not under your full control) [2] Loyalist
  Militia: Militia supportive to the Crown [3] French Army: The French will
  support the American cause after a formal alliance is held. [4] Spanish Army:
  The Spaniards will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held.

  Dharma Doujou was originally released in the arcades by Metro3D in 1994 (picture

  First of all, it has more enemies and features colorful backgrounds borrowed
  from traditional Japanese themes and myths (well, in the Korean version of the
  game, Metro3D apparently threw in a couple of bikini girls for good measure).
  Additionally, the arcade game only contains a story mode and there is no
  progress map or alternate game modes like in the Super Famicom port. But, most
  importantly, the gameplay is slightly different - the player has to move the
  character around the screen in order to hit a block with the mallet. The Super
  Famicon version, on the contrary, automatically aligns the player with the
  furthest most block, and this apparently minor difference makes the gameplay of
  the home conversion more fast-paced and enjoyable than the original.

  Goemon (Kid Ying) and Ebisu-Maru (Dr. Yang) are enjoying themselves at home,

  the other villagers. Concerned, that a new evil has appeared, the two set out to
  confront it at the temple. This is just the beginning of a new adventure that
  will take them Goemon and his partner all across Japan; into moutain villages,
  amusement parks, castle fortresses and more!
  .
  Players control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player
  mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and
  side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages,
  enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a
  weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack
  with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which
  consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the
  player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the
  numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the
  lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such
  as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.
  .
  At the end of each village is an "action area" which changes the game in a
  complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with
  obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves
  used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special
  attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center).
  These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player
  game, characters can ride piggy-back on one another, to avoid getting stuck by a
  scrolling screen.

  The game is an interesting and unique crossover between the 'puzzly' side of
  Tetris and the 'save all the rodents' side of Lemmings. The goal of the game is
  to guide a bald and fun looking creature, who also happens to be a treasure
  hunter called Gussun (and his friend Oyoyo in two players mode), to the level's
  exit. This character just keeps walking around and gets scared at the silliest
  things. While he aimlessly wanders around the playfield, Tetris like pieces fall
  from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them in the
  scene. Once in place, these blocks can be used by Gussun to climb on to reach
  new areas, and eventually lead him through the exit door. Tons of other features
  are also packed with the game, such as bombs or little buddies who follow Gussun
  to the exit (collect 10 of them for an extra life!). Time is of course limited
  and water starts filling up the stage if players stay in one levels for too
  long. Additionally, traps and monsters soon appear and things get quickly tricky
  and will squeeze the juice out of the player's brain in no time. An intense

  Everything about the Fighting King is shrouded in mystery. No one knows who he
  is or where he came from ... only that he rules the land with an iron fist. His
  headquarters is in a secret room at the top of the great Tower, which is guarded
  by more than six enemies with psychotic fighting skills. Many great warriors
  have entered the Tower to overthrow the Fighting King, but none have come back.

  powerful warrior, with the strength and determination to end the reign of terror
  and restore peace to the land. There's just one little problem ... only one
  warrior can enter the Tower at a time. Our champions have decided to hold a

developer: Konami
publisher: Konami
description:
  Sparkster is a 2D side-scrolling platformer starring the eponymous hero who
  previously appeared in Rocket Knight Adventures. It is very different from the
  contemporary Genesis title Sparkster, as it does not continue the story from the
  first game and has completely different levels, enemies and gameplay mechanics.
  In that way it can be considered a spin-off in the series. The introduction
  merely shows how an elderly man captures a girl and takes her into his airship.
  At that point Sparkster appears and he decides to chase them.
  .
  Sparkster is a rodent carrying a rocket pack on his back. He can move around,
  duck, jump and hang from branches or rails. His regular attack is a sword slash
  that sends out a circular projectile. Through the L and R buttons he can dash
  left and right in a circle of fire. Keeping the attack button pressed powers up
  a rocket meter. When full, different types or actions can be performed: dashing
  left, right or up to cover a large distance, ricocheting off walls in a diagonal
  motion, or a stationary attack.
  .
  The game consists of nine levels of which the last two can only be accessed on
  higher difficulty levels. Sparkster collects diamonds for points, defeats all
  types of robot enemies and collects apples to restore his heart meter near the
  top of the screen. Most of the game consists of regular platforming gameplay,
  with a few diversions where Sparkster rides a robot bird, or is shown from a
  top-down view flying in the air like a vertically-scrolling shooter. All levels
  have a level boss along with a large number of mid-level bosses. The game
  supports a password system.

  A long time ago the kingdoms of wind, fire, earth and water\n

  only be used by a Firestriker. The kingdom of wind won and united the four
  kingdoms. Wylde however, was not satisfied with peace and conjured four monsters
  to overthrow the united world. Now, only the kingdom of wind remains and the
  player takes control over the last Firestriker to free the other kingdoms and
  defeat the monsters.
  .
  Even though Firestriker looks like a typical SNES RPG, it is in fact an action
  game that has more in common with a pinball-game than with any other genre. The
  Trialight is a ball of fire that basically behaves like a pinball. The player
  controls the Firestriker who can freely walk across the screen and strike at the
  Trialight to control its movement. Levels are filled with obstacles, destroyable
  block and monsters. Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the Trialight.
  The goal of each level is to maneuver the Trialight towards the exit of the
  screen. The exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles and sometimes
  certain conditions (such as killing all monsters or destroying certain objects)
  have to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. If the Firestriker is
  killed or the Trialight falls off the screen, the player loses a life.
  Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can use the shoulder buttons to
  control a magician who (in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the
  screen. The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map.
  As the game progresses, the player will also fight several bosses and free other
  Firestrikers whose special abilities are necessary to complete the game.

  Firestriker also features a two-player cooperative mode as well as a duel-mode
  for up to four players.

developer: EA Sports
publisher: EA Sports
description:
  PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and
  technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic
  courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are
  in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of
  the console allow).
  .
  The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were
  digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive,
  driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match
  and Shootout), as well as a replay.
  .
  Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to
  start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's
  possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and
  pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a
  bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit
  areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in
  pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However,
  only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice
  levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.

  The game is divided into adventure and platform action modes. In adventure mode,
  Doraemon walks around towns, talking to people and entering houses. Key
  locations lead to platform levels, which must be completed to advance the story.
  Platform levels include plenty of obstacles (pits, spikes, self-destructing
  platforms etc.), as well as various enemies who try to stop the heroes. You can
  choose one of the six available characters to play through the platform level.
  They all can jump and defeat enemies either by jumping on their heads or by

  cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients
  can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the
  chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to

  What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono
  turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle,
  little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention,
  and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and
  space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering
  the one who would destroy the flow of time.
  .
  Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for
  such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat
  skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in
  power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" -
  special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in
  battle.
  .
  The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy
  games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo
  attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple
  Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using
  their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the
  enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them
  entirely.
  .
  The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time,
  which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option,
  which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds
  even more endings to the already existing ones.

  Following the success of Mario no Super Picross on the Super Famicom, Nintendo

  substantial number of puzzles of varying sizes and difficulty. A large number of
  these puzzles would later be rereleased as downloadable content for Picross DS.
  The puzzle solving gameplay of the titles is nearly identical to that of their
  direct predecessor Mario no Super Picross just with minor changes in the
  presentation. Notably, Mario and Wario are no longer featured as guides through
  the game modes. Also, the stone chiseling archaeologist motif that was present
  in the previous titles has been dropped in favor of a simple pen-on-paper style.

description:
  Konami's Gradius and space-shooter parody series continues with this second
  installment.  Gameplay is similar to the Gradius series in that you control a
  ship that can move anywhere on the screen while the screen itself scrolls from
  left to right. Enemies appear in waves and destroying all the fighters in a
  single wave releases power-ups which may be used to choose your ships upgrade.
  The Upgrade bar too is lifted from Gradius, however each character has different
  names and functions for their upgrades.
  .
  In Gokujyou Parodius, you are now able to now choose from 11 different
  characters... many of whom appear from other Konami games. They include:
  .
  1. Vic Viper: a ship from Gradius
  .
  2. Takosuke: the "octopus" of the previous Parodius game, and also seen in at
  least one Goemon
  .
  3. Twinbee: making his appearance from the Twinbee side scrolling games, Twinbee
  is a squat round robot with a jetpack and a disproportionately big punching
  glove
  .
  4. Pentaro: the original "joke character", Pentaro made an appearence in a
  previous Gradius title as a flying penguin. However he does star in his own
  games as well, Konami's Penguin Adventure
  .
  5. Hikaru: Hikaru is a girl in a tight fighting "bunny suit" who is riding on
  top of a missile
  .
  6. Mambo: Mambo is a strange looking fish with two horns on the top of his head
  and on his underside
  .
  7. Michael: some kind of fat angel pig. He has wings and a golden halo over his
  head
  .
  8. Koitsu: A blue stick man riding on a surfboard. He's probably one of the more
  'normal' characters
  .
  9. Goemon: star of the Goemon series of games. Goemon is a ninja warrior
  equipped with wooden pipes. He flies around in a superman pose for his
  appearance in Parodius
  .
  10. Dracula: star of Konami's Kid Dracula, this white haired squat character
  retains his vampiric abilities including that of being able to change into a bat
  .
  11. Upa: a flying baby. Upa is actually from a Konami game by the name of
  Bokutte Upa but is probably just more recognizable as "the flying baby" of this
  crazy shooter
  .
  In addition to your player-character, the levels themselves will be full of a
  strange mix of Konami references, bright colors and the just plain zany. it's
  not uncommon to have to fly your ship underneath a woman's legs for example or
  chased by a giant walrus or having enemies shooting cute pink hearts at you.

developer: BEC

description:
  This is an RPG that was only released on the SNES, which also shares its name
  with several other titles across different systems, due to them all being based
  on the same Anime series "Patlabor".\n
  In this RPG, you control the two main pilots from the series/films, Noa Izumi
  and Isao Ota, as you complete your typical duties each day, helping to deal with
  rogue Labors (Mecha) and other such incidents. The game, only having been
  released in Japan, is only really advisable to play if you understand Japanese,
  as it really is a text-heavy game.\n
  The gameplay consists of three screens - a map of Japan, showing where your
  asignments are located, the "main" screen, where you control your Labor from a
  top-down viewpoint and maneuver it around the area of the crime. Finally,
  there's the combat screen, for when you press the action button to attack a
  rogue Labor. From here you can select one of various attacks; naturally, as the
  game goes on your pilots can learn new attacks, though unusually for an RPG
  there's also the option to just talk with the rogue Labor's pilot and try to
  convince them to back down - as a policeman, sometimes this is the only way
  forward.\n
  This is a fairly typical Eastern RPG with a fairly unique setting. Just don't
  forget your Kanji-English dictionary!

  Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle ("Nontan and Friends: Round-and-Round Puzzle")
  is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and Game Boy. It was released exclusively
  in Japan and is based on the Nontan books for younger children that follows the
  eponymous mischievous kitten and his animal friends on their adventures. The
  game is a twist on the standard block-stacking puzzle game.
  .
  Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is one of the few games that Game Freak worked
  on before they created their breakout hit Pokémon.
  .
  The goal of Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is to stack blocks so that two
  matching icons are connected to one another adjacently and vanish. The player
  cannot rotate the two-piece blocks that fall from the top: instead, they flip
  the blocks around to reveal two different blocks on the opposite side. Most of
  the flipped blocks are linked to their originals: a fish becomes a fish
  skeleton, an apple becomes an apple half, etc. Sometimes they're rare bee or
  character face blocks instead: both are rare and are therefore difficult to
  clear once one appears, but two face blocks will eliminate an entire row when
  connected and are thus worth the hassle.
  .
  The game has an endless single-player mode that only ends once the blocks reach
  the top of the screen. There is also a two-player mode.

  these puzzles would later be rereleased as downloadable content for Picross DS.
  The puzzle solving gameplay of the titles is nearly identical to that of their
  direct predecessor Mario no Super Picross just with minor changes in the

  torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or
  morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph

publisher: Interplay
description:
  RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware's R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's
  Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It
  is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer.
  .
  Combat, obstacles, and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role.
  There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement,
  dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro, and mines.
  Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks, and armor.
  .
  There are full race season, single race, and custom track modes. In 1 player
  games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each
  associated with their own vehicle.
  .
  In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st;
  often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an
  additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where
  fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player
  may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player
  also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become
  necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going
  up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before.
  .
  Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can
  set the track's laps, gravity, and starting line type. Each track section can be
  pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D
  non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical
  straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and
  converging multiple paths in any direction, and a criss-cross. Either a
  horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid.
  The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1
  forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6
  slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1),
  inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for
  height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections
  is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If
  the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the
  player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error
  immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved.
  Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid
  section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging
  and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around
  and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are
  generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be
  diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs,
  valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2, and AI
  players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.

  You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing,

  Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render
  your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that
  inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer.

  Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general.
  Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons
  research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to
  survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule,
  you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push

  Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character
  of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name.  The game was a
  multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula
  although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they
  surrender and can be arrested.
  .
  The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge
  Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and
  prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty
  that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired
  by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on
  Deadworld.

  a distance and "Test Tubes" filled with chemical explosives which will damage
  all enemies on the screen.

  dimension, left or right. The Batarang is the standard weapon here, with punches
  only being used when the enemy gets close. Also in these levels, Batman can use
  a grappling hook to cross dangerous areas unharmed.

  Enemies in the beat'em'up levels usually belong to the Penguin's Red Triangle
  Circus Gang - clowns in all varieties: thin clowns, fat clowns, clowns on bikes,
  clowns armed with bazookas, and more. At the end of each level there is a boss
  fight, including several encounters with Catwoman and the Penguin.

  The game is based on the animÃ© series Ranma 1/2. It tells the story of the
  young martial artist Ranma Saotome. Traveling with his father Genma across
  China, Ranma discovered a cursed spring. When he and his father fell into that
  spring, they were both transformed: Ranma into a little girl, Genma into a panda
  bear. Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they
  are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms.
  .
  The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their
  friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma
  finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps
  strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader
  of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him
  to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world. Ranma and his
  friends will do anything to rescue Genma and to stop Kamusaru's evil plans!
  .
  The game features many characters from the animÃ©, including Ranma's fiancee
  Akane, the fighter Ryouga, the amazon warrior Shampoo who is in love with Ranma,
  and others. The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights
  random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final
  Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various
  offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic
  points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties
  can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every
  time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed"
  form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example,
  Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).

  Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world
  from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a
  vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them.
  At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.
  .
  In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At
  first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form
  where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or
  regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can
  transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage
  and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses,
  such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By
  picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on
  screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.
  .
  To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the
  level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed,
  will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki
  to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after
  the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.

  In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship
  Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn
  for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a
  destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The
  Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain.
  Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The
  commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module"
  mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld,
  apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack
  by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish
  must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to
  return home.

  Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien
  galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and
  areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when
  aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning
  worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew
  members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and
  explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which
  can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned
  in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency
  or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts",
  which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts
  unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules
  and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and
  also the six pilots each carry different skills.
  .
  Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the
  side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order
  to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is
  unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are
  consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and
  one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is
  destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first
  aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and
  defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.

  American and National Conference teams, and if you're good enough, you can take
  them all the way to the Super Bowl! Team rosters are broken down into positions
  and individually rated according to skills, with position upgrade packages,
  player ability handicapping, actual NFL Offensive and Defensive Playbook
  alignments with audibles and even variable wind direction and strength. You not
  only coach from the sidelines, you also control all the movements of the players
  on the field. Run, pass, catch, kick, punt, jump, tackle, block and dive... Refs
  even call penalties. No matter what kind of fan you are, whether you know the
  rulebook inside-out or just watch an occasional game on TV... this is the one
  football game you've got to have!

game: Shooter

description:
  Shooter, a Super Nintendo horizontal space shooter, never actually made it into
  production but rather served as an in-house tech demo for Punk Development to
  test scrolling backgrounds. The game demo boots up to a Punk Development logo
  screen before heading straight into the action. Player One controls the red
  spaceship, Player Two, the blue. Both ships can fire with the B button and move
  up, down, left, or right around the strikingly phallic-looking space scenery.
  The game can also be paused with the Start button (although the starry
  background will continue to scroll). A few generic-looking space pods parade
  around as well as what can only be described as giant grasshoppers
  (spacehoppers?). Crashing into any one of these floating pieces of space debris
  will cause the player's ship to explode. Never fear, after going down in flames,
  a replacement ship will appear. Overall, this demo is very basic. A constant,
  low humming noise makes up the game's entire audio ambiance, unless if you count
  the single sound effect that plays during the opening. The scrolling level loops
  infinitely.

developer: I'Max

description:
  A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two
  characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite
  similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a
  vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen,
  but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have
  to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health
  bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished
  the game ends.
  .
  There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:\n
  Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs,
  dragons or swords.\n
  Bottles heal a certain amount of health.\n
  Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.
  .
  Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more
  grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary
  blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.
  .
  More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of
  which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have
  different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and
  clearing the bottom three lines.

game: Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius
file: Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius (Japan).zip
developer: Konami
publisher: Konami
description:
  The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that
  substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather)
  of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right
  (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and
  avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a
  difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or
  harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice
  that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the
  level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest
  characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts
  of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other
  words, it's Parodius!
  .
  There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red,
  used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different
  coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are
  worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives),  Blue Bells are "big bombs"
  that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them,
  White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese
  phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies
  (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense
  lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a
  short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the
  strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.
  .
  This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the
  power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar
  "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:\n
  Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody,
  equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons\n
  2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the
  two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles
  and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun
  instead of a double shot.\n
  3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved.
  Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities
  from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple
  enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles\n
  4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's
  girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly
  identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon\n
  5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star.
  Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are
  nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...\n
  6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee,
  except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power
  them up to harm enemies that touch them.\n
  7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus.
  And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from
  previous Parodius games.\n
  8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to
  Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead
  identical to the Vic Viper.\n
  9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays
  similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser
  weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen
  onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking.
  Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other
  abilities stronger\n
  10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange
  stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options
  instead\n
  11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as
  well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a
  shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also
  has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities
  stronger.\n
  12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays
  similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple
  directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims
  towards enemies.\n
  13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave
  weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a
  multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get
  really powerful\n
  14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward)
  with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon
  wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels
  forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's
  missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the
  form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.\n
  15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with
  standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons
  however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen
  when fired.\n
  16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons
  are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game.
  For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th...
  requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her
  weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.

  Combos. Scenarios will also be different (mainly based on Buu saga) and will
  include alternative versions of themselves with different times of the day as
  well.

  The game allows you to take part either in a 8 player martial arts tournament
  with an eliminatory system or to make single combats against the CPU or another
  player. This makes Super Butouden 3 the only game of the series without a Story
  Mode,. It can be explained by the fact that when the game was released the Buu
  saga was still on a very early stage in Japanese TV.

developer: Nintendo

description:
  Sutte Hakkun is a puzzle action game in the shape of a platformer. The playing
  character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is
  able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky
  above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down,
  collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges
  upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku
  makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks â€” that will be
  done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then â€” and sucking
  potions â€” that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with
  new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid â€” from jars. A level
  is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor
  enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the
  score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level,
  and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for
  completing levels with as little moves as possible.
  .
  Before reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was
  released for and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four
  versions. Given data size limitations, only one of the four of those, released
  for use with the Nintendo Power cartridge, could include all the levels designed
  by game creators: that is the one released as a Super Famicom standard cartridge
  later, and on Wii's Virtual console eventually.

  various punches, kicks, combos and special moves.\n
  Special gadgets to be used include the famous Batarang to take out enemies from
  a distance and "Test Tubes" filled with chemical explosives which will damage
  all enemies on the screen.

  In the second type of side-scrolling level, Batman can only move in one
  dimension, left or right. The Batarang is the standard weapon here, with punches
  only being used when the enemy gets close. Also in these levels, Batman can use
  a grappling hook to cross dangerous areas unharmed.
  .
  Enemies in the beat'em'up levels usually belong to the Penguin's Red Triangle
  Circus Gang - clowns in all varieties: thin clowns, fat clowns, clowns on bikes,
  clowns armed with bazookas, and more. At the end of each level there is a boss
  fight, including several encounters with Catwoman and the Penguin.

description:
  The game puts players in command of a railway company. There are no rival
  companies; the player controls the only one in the city and the game is
  resultingly fairly open-ended. There are two types of transport that the
  player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more
  likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever
  the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct
  buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area
  grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra
  revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow
  can be seen as a goal in itself. As well as the buildings built by the computer,
  in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own
  buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the

description:
  Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is
  hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all
  hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching
  its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the
  hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero
  from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings
  his friend along for the ride.
  .
  There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has
  you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one
  or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat,
  while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited
  supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock
  up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that
  get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like
  bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.
  .
  You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if
  rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're
  energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of
  energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them
  if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the
  mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be
  difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of
  fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.
  .
  There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend
  on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot
  instead of the mission eight boss.

description:
  Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy
  God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged,
  terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them -
  surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her
  powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after
  thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for
  you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.
  .
  Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear
  role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super
  Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and
  were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play
  the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate
  evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different
  abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and
  pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is
  turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II
  on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific
  abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and
  Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked
  during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new
  ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous
  element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly
  enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good
  considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple
  playthroughs to truly master the system.

  Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the
  colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and
  the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match
  the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and
  comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy
  panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of
  them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning
  panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over.
  Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which
  can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up
  points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.

description:
  BS Special Tee Shot is a game that was planned to be released on the SNES,
  though eventually was just made exclusively for the Super Famicom's Satellaview
  service. The game was later retooled and made into the game that is known as
  Kirby's Dream Course. It is unknown why the game was remade to feature Kirby
  characters, though it's presumed that it as because Nintendo thought that the
  game would prove more successful with a well known brand behind it.\n
  The Satellaview video game had unique characters rather than already developed
  ones. Overall, however, the player character was uninspiring as it was simply
  just a red sphere that bounced around. Despite the fact that the game would be
  remade to feature Kirby characters, there are dramatic differences between the
  two titles, including the overall gameplay concept and levels. For example, in
  this game, the goal was simply to shoot the ball in the hole, while in the Kirby
  game you want to crash into enemies to destroy them. However, despite this, the
  games still share many similarities, such as graphics and the overall way the
  player controls the ball.
  .
  Interestingly, Special Tee Shot was featured not only in magazines but also on
  the back of SNES packages as advertisements before ultimately being cancelled
  and brought back with Kirby characters. It should also be noted that before
  being titled Kirby's Dream Course, the game was officially called Kirby's Tee
  Shot.

  Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because
  initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport
  will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.

  The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main
  screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story
  mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the
  television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using
  Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third
  but I think there is a need for further explanation.
  .
  Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots
  and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence
  of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will
  fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the
  playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will
  not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental
  animations depending on the player used.

  The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead
  of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so
  on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the
  Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout
  has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to
  stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including
  switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings
  as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.
  .
  The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any
  point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to

  all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and

  Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the
  popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to
  battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player
  fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four.
  The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as
  the game progresses new characters become available.
  .
  During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three
  command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes
  available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking,
  glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing
  either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the
  status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack
  levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing
  their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also
  accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade
  within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when
  they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still
  available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of
  movement.
  .
  After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and
  choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to
  revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.

  ?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his
  world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening
  the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times
  prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best
  soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather
  smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not
  familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his
  noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.
  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if
  his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up
  waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being
  tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular
  amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your
  capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some
  points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time
  Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you
  have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of
  meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will
  be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one
  where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know,
  the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the
  ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of
  Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump
  as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead
  serious.

description:
  If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their
  natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing
  miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain
  found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the
  sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.
  .
  These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track
  painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you
  racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well,
  with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of
  you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to
  avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.
  .
  Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one
  player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting
  your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you
  should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after
  every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within
  your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a
  time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.
  .
  The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4
  points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car
  off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which
  involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level,
  although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared
  the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks
  are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system
  as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

  The goal of the game is to fire at the balloons that appear at the top of the
  screen to pop them. By shooting a balloon adjacent to another of the same color,
  the player pops both simultaneously. By popping a large number of balloons
  simultaneously, they can create trash for the other player to clear - these
  appear as gray balloons that can't easily be popped directly but disappear when
  multiple balloons are popped near them.
  .
  The player can select between nine Sailor Guardians in the vs. mode (all except
  Saturn), but is restricted to Sailors Moon, Chibi Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter
  and Venus for the single-player story mode. Sailor Saturn appears in-game as an
  advisor, but is not playable. The game was followed by a sequel the following
  year: Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2. It also received a
  fan translation in 2016.

  game take place 20 or 30 years after the hero of the first game followed the
  neutral path, defeated the Asura Lord and the seraph Michael at the Cathedral,
  and founded a state where followers of both Law and Chaos ideals could live

  "Ryu Knight" is based on an animÃ© series of the same name. The story of the
  game is simple: you are Adyu, an apprentice knight who spends all his time
  training. One day, a mysterious old man appears out of nowhere, approaches Adyu
  and tells him the world needs more paladins, and therefore you must train harder
  in order to become one. He sends you on a quest to find a legendary weapon,
  which is broken into twelve parts, each part being hidden in a different place.
  He also entrusts you with the power of Ryu, a huge magical armor that grants the
  hero who equips it immense power. This is where Adyu's journey begins!

  The game is an action RPG, somewhat similar to  Ys series. Adyu wanders through
  the world and fights enemies in real-time combat, using melee weapons. He can

  much stronger, but you can't go through narrow corridors and climb up stairs
  when in Ryu form. The game features mostly open areas populated by enemies with
  an occasional town thrown in. The structure of the game is non-linear: you can

developer: Bandai Namco
publisher: Bandai Namco
description:
  A 1995 Japan-exclusive Captain Tsubasa video game developed and published by
  Bandai and was the final Captain Tsubasa game for the Super Famicom.\n
  This game suffered lots of changes from previous games made by Tecmo, this time
  you will be playing in a real soccer field and in real time, which means that
  you need to press certain keys even without having the chance of stopping the
  time (like in previous games), When a certain player is confronted with a one
  that he considers his rival (like Misugi and Schneider or Tsubasa and *any other
  player*, for example) they will have a fight, which is mainly a button smashing
  sequence. The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any
  of the special shots.\n
  This game has almost the same story as the Captain Tsubasa J anime, except that
  this one will finish with a special match against an extra team. So, you'll play
  across various chapters, playing with Aoi Shingo in Italy or controlling the
  mythic Ozora Tsubasa in his match against the brazillian prodigy, Carlos Santana
  (nope, he isn't the singer). You'll also play with Japan national team against
  the same opponents as they did in the anime version..

description:
  Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey game based on the 1990 arcade
  game from Williams. Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals than any
  sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for
  wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team's
  goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and
  it is possible to do a "super shot" which is strong enough to send the goalie
  into the net along with the puck.
  .
  Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two
  players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also
  adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a "shot race" mode where
  the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.

  Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light.
  They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu
  appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to
  be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to
  defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so
  easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just
  stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a
  death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...
  .
  The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as
  both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and
  each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes
  chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite
  sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric
  perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is
  divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and
  Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu
  uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from
  scrolls he receives after battles.

description:
  First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet
  (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army).
  The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which
  can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its
  own surprises.
  .
  Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use
  whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go
  to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can
  freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.
  .
  Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for
  better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put
  protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser
  turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will
  build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.
  .
  Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to
  dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area
  you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll
  start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level
  up then the at previous level.
  .
  If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush
  the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what
  its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same
  level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy
  soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.
  .
  The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and
  lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your
  men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes...
  to dominate the world and crush your opponents.
  .
  You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your
  men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of
  age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.

  Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for

  special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in
  battle.

  The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy
  games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo
  attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple
  Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using

  enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them
  entirely.

  The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time,
  which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option,

  The goal of the game is identical to that of Puyo Puyo: players remove blocks on

  reactions of eliminations, the player can create trash that gets dropped on
  their opponent, making their game harder.

  Pro Yakyuu Nettou Puzzle Stadium adds extra features to coincide with the
  baseball theme: one player is "batting" while the other is "pitching", and the
  game alternates which player is which. The goal of the former is to create
  combos and quickly eliminate sets to fill bases, which eventually leads to
  points on the table. The goal of the latter is to quickly eliminate sets so they
  can be the batting player again. The pitching player has the advantage, as trash
  vanishes quicker for them, which means the batting player has to move fast to

description:
  Momotarou is a boy who was found by an old couple in a giant peach, according to
  an old Japanese folk tale. When he grew up, he defeated the evil demons from the
  Demon Island, and three years later found a way to save his land from the wrath
  of Emma, the King of Hell. But a new threat has appeared now! The demonic king
  Basara sends his henchman Karura to the moon, to kidnap Kaguya-hime, the
  legendary Moon Princess, in order for her to marry his son, Prince Daida.
  Momotarou prepares his magic carriage and flies to the moon, attempting to
  rescue Kaguya-hime. But he doesn't suspect how strong his foes really are...
  .
  The sequel to the first two Momotarou Densetsu games is very similar to its
  predecessors in terms of gameplay. Moving around Momotarou and his party members
  over the world map (which has become 3D by now), you visit towns, buy weapons
  and accessories, talk to people, and fight random enemies and bosses in
  turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.

description:
  Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART
  racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel
  Mansell.
  .
  The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice
  is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some
  variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in
  Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen
  or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are
  played in the race.\n
  A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in
  the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must
  be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a
  disqualification.
  .
  Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform
  (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several
  polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.

  group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers.
  On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy,

  .
  FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other
  titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party
  of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

  In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns
  moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows
  all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an
  inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary
  according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while
  most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive
  powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from
  the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by
  magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.
  .
  Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other
  statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after
  slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle.
  Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.
  .
  The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the
  landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the
  encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while
  another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color,
  adjust sound volume and rename the party members.
  .
  In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the
  place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles,
  the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end
  of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party
  members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.

  combination). However, now you will also count with the Meteo combos, which

  quickly recharge your energy. Special moves can be also fired back in
  retaliation to your rival's attack, marking then the beginning of a button
  smashing duel.

  paths and changes depending on the outcome of battles; a 1 vs 1 mode, where you
  can battle against another player or the CPU; and a martial arts tournament mode
  with an eliminatory system in which you and other players (or the CPU) choose a

  This is a real-time war strategy game. The game time is divided into months,
  each month taking a few minutes of real time. You control the hero and his
  generals, each one commanding units of foot soldiers. You send your army
  commanders through the world map to capture enemy castles. Once all the castles
  are captured, a new construction appears on the map, where the level boss
  resides, and your final goal in the chapter (tale) is to defeat this boss. Once
  you run into an enemy, an automatic battle sequence occurs, which you can
  interrupt, assigning commands to your army. Both Hanjuku and Kanjuku armies can
  summon powerful creatures called Egg Monsters, who can fight against a whole
  army or against each other in turn-based combat. Each month a "monthly event"
  occurs, such as changes in the land, earthquake, etc. Random events also pop
  out, during which you can buy supplies for your army.

description:
  The people of Bizyland were hard-working and prosperous. However, Wagamama, the
  queen of Lasyland was jealous and used the power of her magic mirror. The spell
  that was cast would switch the realms of Bizyland and Lasyland around. The only
  people left unaffected by the spell were those who were not hard-working:
  notably the king of Bizyland as well as two children and a robot who were
  playing that day. Using the king's magic chalk, they must travel over Lasyland
  and restore enough of a percentage of each area so as to break the spell over
  each region.
  .
  Cacoma Knight is a puzzle-painting game. Choosing one of the three characters,
  the player will begin each level only able to move around the edges. The player
  can start using the chalk to move away from the edges and draw a line over the
  darkened area and reach another edge. Once a section (always the smaller) is
  "chalked off" from the rest, it will be restored. Any treasure chests revealed
  will be opened for points bonuses. Different enemies will walk along the chalk
  lines or fly in between them. They can be destroyed by being in a section of the

  all characters can also block attacks, perform single heavy attacks, special
  attacks that consume a certain amount of energy and super attacks. Super attacks
  damage all enemies on-screen, but can only be used twice per continue. If a
  character is hit repeatedly, there is a chance that they temporarily switch into
  "angry-mode" during which they are invincible and more powerful.
  .
  Most levels offer different paths and exits, and after every level, a different
  character may be selected. This means that levels may be played through in
  different orders and that it is not at all necessary to play through all the
  levels to reach one of several endings.

description:
  As the hero, you must climb up a monster-ridden tower to defeat Drokkmar, master
  of the Blackorb. To do this, you must defeat his army that stands in your way
  with whatever weapon you are carrying. Health is decreased by coming into
  contact with various monsters, attacks, traps, and the passage of time. It is
  increased by finding food. Every certain amount of points, a "Food Fairy"
  appears and drops off food as well.
  .
  Throughout your journey, you can smash open chests to find treasure and
  artifacts. Some of these artifacts can be recovered that alter gameplay, such as
  providing more damage or increased magical power. Also throughout your journey,
  you can collect keys, which are used to free imprisoned allies, who not only
  help you defeat monsters, but also leave you an item that will help you on your
  quest. Only one person can join you at a time.
  .
  As you progress through the tower, you will be granted new magical weapons after
  each boss you defeat. The weapons are affected by a "magic bar" that charges
  over time. When this bar is fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged
  attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff
  will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by
  jumping and attacking, but doing this costs health.
  .
  There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can
  be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular
  spot.

developer: Acclaim

description:
  This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the
  NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and
  deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories,
  from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.
  .
  Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player
  for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face
  each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player
  with a CPU team-mate.
  .
  The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for
  substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which
  lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover.
  Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes
  four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:
  .
  1. "Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to
  a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.
  .
  Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when
  picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy,
  monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other
  players to the ground.
  .
  "Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.
  .
  "Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and
  challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra
  players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher
  CPU difficulty level.

  elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard
  single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through
  training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players
  against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual
  additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in
  which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning
  and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.The
  standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too
  aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a
  hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina
  causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer
  carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in
  order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more
  resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the
  dangers as they show up.

  the second of three games based on the license to be released for the Super

  It features characters and plot details from Kishin Douji Zenki, usually just

  Kurama - the manga/anime begins with Kurama's return and Chiaki accidentally
  releasing Zenki.

  The game is unusual as it splits its time between two modes that are distinct
  both tonally and mechanically. The "mature" Zenki, in his most powerful form,
  fights various demon minions of Kurama in tactical one-on-one battles that use a
  real-time progress bar that needs to be filled at least partially before an
  attack can be launched. This mode is similar to the gameplay used in other anime
  license action games, such as YuYu Hakusho and YuYu Hakusho Tokubetsu Hen. The
  other mode is a more cartoonish platformer featuring Chiaki as she attempts to
  assist Zenki by completing various objectives. Chiaki resorts to her magic to

  "Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense
  of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was
  hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for
  yearly revisions of the concept.
  .
  There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of
  other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the
  time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents
  and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and
  systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.
  .
  The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game
  even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system
  .
  FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown
  players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and
  Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to
  match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can
  also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World
  Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can
  create your own dream team through the custom team creator.

  Shadowhawk is a comic by Image Comics (or rather their sister studio,

  wanted to retain copyright of their creations. Jim Valentino was one of those
  people, and he created Shadowhawk, an anti-hero who went on a vendetta after
  getting attacked and infected with HIV. This comic came out during the explosion
  of the medium in the early 90s, and I have to admit that I was not into it at
  all.\n
  Valentino, seeing the success of the 16-bit era consoles and a crossover with
  Shadowhawk's main audience, apparently decided to finance the creation of a
  video game. However, it never saw the light of day, much like other games based
  on lesser known comics, such as Prime and Firearm.\n
  The game is split into two modes. It featured one or two platforming stages,
  followed by a Mortal Kombat-style boss fight. After beating each level, you get
  a cut scene with the story, and usually a hint at who the next boss is.

  Gameplay
  .
  The goal of the game is to move around a board which encircles a giant grid. The
  player can buy property on any square on the grid that is parallel to the space
  they're on, increasing the rent value of that space. When other players land on
  the same space, they pay the controlling player(s) a specific amount of rent a
  la Monopoly. With some smart planning, the player can purchase many properties
  along the same row or column and boost their rent prices higher and higher.
  Building properties on adjacent spaces on the grid also creates corporations,
  which generate more cash and can absorb smaller companies alongside them. Corner
  spaces on the outer ring lead to slot machine mini-games that can earn players a
  bit of extra cash.

  the god of darkness, plotted evil schemes until he was defeated and sealed by
  the god of light, Risk. Years have past, and the evil demon lord Bido is trying
  to resurrect Daar. According to an ancient prophecy, only eight heroes, the
  bearers of magic pearls, can stop Bido's evil plans: eight heroes who come from
  different parts of Kypros, unaware of their great mission. Among those heroes
  are the young pirate Zan Hayate, the fighter of the wosshu tribe Gonza and his
  little sister Maimai, the beautiful sorceress Lilian Lancelot, and others.
  .
  Before the eight heroes unite for their ultimate journey, you play their
  introductory stories. You travel on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons
  on your way. The combat is turn-based, viewed from first person perspective.
  Enemies appear randomly. Each hero has his/her own unique techniques to use in
  battles.

  The story and general gameplay of Hachigyoku no Yuushi Densetsu is similar to
  those of the original  Burai: Jouken for PC-98 and MSX; however, the console
  versions were developed from scratch and therefore differ greatly from the
  computer ones, having new cut-scenes, dialogues, battle interface, etc. Perhaps
  the most important difference gameplay-wise is the linear nature of chapters. In
  the computer versions, the player can choose to start as any of the eight
  selectable heroes; in the console versions, the player has to start with Gonza
  and Maimai.

description:
  SD The Great Battle is a top-down platformer/shooter that features characters
  from the Ultraman, Kamen Rider and Mobile Suit Gundam universes. It is the first
  game in what would be known as the Compati Hero Series. As well as for stylistic
  reasons, characters are super deformed -- turned into cartoonish caricatures
  with large heads and small bodies -- so that characters from the three
  franchises can be depicted at heights comparative to one another. Normally,
  Kamen Rider characters are human-sized whereas most Gundam Mobile Suits and
  Ultraman (and his kaiju opponents) are around 50-200 feet tall.

game: The Brainies

developer: Titus
publisher: Titus
description:
  This puzzle game has 101 levels, in which you have to guide a varying number of
  Brainies of four different colors onto a spot that matches their color. You
  control a cross-hair, and press fire while over a Brainy to take or give up
  control of its motion. Running out of time costs you a life.
  .
  The challenge lies in the fact that you can only control the direction in which
  a Brainy will walk. Once this is set, he will continue to walk until he hits a
  wall, an obstacle or another Brainy.
  .
  To make things a bit more complicated, there are various obstacles like arrows
  that change the direction a Brainy is walking in and items than can optionally
  be picked up.

  This game brings the US cartoon character Dennis the Menace's menacing treatment
  of poor old Mr. Wilson to the computer screen, around the time of the film also
  released in 1993.
  .
  Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr.
  Wilson’s house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level
  opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The
  enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from
  bottom-left to top-right anyway.
  .
  Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms.
  Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives
  are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice
  between music and sound effects is offered.

game: Sid Meier's Civilization
file: Sid Meier's Civilization (USA).zip
developer: Koei
publisher: Koei
description:
  Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a
  leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the
  XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual
  goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out
  everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.
  .
  As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build
  cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of
  people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food
  (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build
  military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money,
  science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much
  trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that
  your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse
  into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation.
  .
  If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions,
  such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only
  one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you
  complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will
  eventually stop working.
  .
  There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll
  have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you
  can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific
  knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but
  eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military
  units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly
  taking over them).
  .
  Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create
  roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities,
  increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with
  the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to
  join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can
  be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can
  also help in building Wonders of the World.
  .
  Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your
  cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be
  finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the
  game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you
  some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting
  effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your
  citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too
  much of it, global warming may occur.
  .
  How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your
  nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of
  your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy,
  Republic, Democracy or Communism.

  Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to
  ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for
  replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback,
  Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical
  armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir
  Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir
  Zeke,  they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so,
  the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of
  which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to
  defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.
  .
  King Arthur & the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be
  mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the
  course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional
  party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various
  areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members
  are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down,
  left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can
  swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much
  strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time,
  but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur
  has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be
  restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur
  can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu
  functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the
  statistics of the knights.

  Young Ness was asleep one night when a loud crashing noise awoke him suddenly.
  As he rushes out of bed and up to a nearby hill, he encounters a strange meteor,
  carrying a single passenger: a mysterious insect-like being named Buzz Buzz.
  Buzz Buzz tells him that in the future, an evil alien being known as Giygas has
  conquered the world, and the only one who can stop him are 4 young kids: 3 boys
  and a girl. Ness, of course, is one of the chosen ones... Ness now must find the
  other three children: Paula, a young girl with remarkable psychic powers, Jeff,
  a mechanical genius, and Poo, the young Prince of Dahlaam. Together, these four
  friends have the power to defeat Giygas and save the world from his chaotic
  reign!
  .
  EarthBound is a top-down RPG where you travel around Eagleland and various
  other, exotic countries, trying to end Giygas' evil influence.
  .
  On the way, Ness and his friends will encounter a lot of enemies and battle them
  in turn-based combat. Each turn, each of the characters in the party can attack
  with their weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic
  powers that can hurt enemies, heal comrades and more; some also have some other,
  unique special powers), use an item or try and escape. The game features
  "rolling HP meters" - when a character is dealt damage, it's not all taken away
  from his HP right away, but instead his HP decreases slowly; if the combat is
  ended quickly, even a massively damaging attack can leave a character with only
  minor injuries. By winning battles, characters receive experience and thus
  become stronger.

  If your characters are strong enough, weak enemies will escape from them instead

  paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types
  of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the
  door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything

description:
  Universal Soldier was in development by a company called Carolco and was to be
  published by Accolade. The game was actually a sequel to the Manfred Trentz
  game, Turrican, but the character sprite was changed so that it could be
  rebranded as a movie tie-in. A rom of what appears to be the complete version of
  this game exists. The enemies and gameplay closely match Turrican, as to be
  expected. It is unknown why this game was canceled. Genesis and Game Boy
  versions of this game were released, and Turrican 2 was released on various
  computer platforms. Nintendo Power commented in the October 1992 issue that it
  was similar to Contra, but complained about the poor controls.\n
  The game was originally developed using the original C64 source code and Amiga
  graphics as a base. At a late stage in the development, Accolade also acquired
  rights to produce a game spin-off of the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Universal
  Soldier and decided to rebrand the game as Universal Soldier. Turrican's sprite
  was changed into a marine and several other substitutions were made. Amongst
  other changes, the eyeballs-walking-on-fingers became mini tanks, and instead of
  a large mech/steel dragon in the first stage, the player now faces a large
  representation of Dolph Lundgren's character in the film.\n
  The three shoot 'em up stages, cut out from the port, were replaced by the
  developers with three original stages (a Vietnam jungle, a fortress, and a
  motel/car junkyard) that in theory should link the game to the film's
  atmosphere. The rest of the original Turrican II stages are still present and
  remain mostly intact in overall design, though some of them appear in different

developer: JVC
publisher: JVC
description:
  The story of this game is based on Episode IV: A New Hope, the first of the
  original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The player initially controls the movie's
  main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the
  careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game
  generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the
  most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing
  princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE
  Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.
  .
  Most of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke,
  Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting
  enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include
  standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five
  different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive
  destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access
  to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use
  stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.
  .
  Some of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land
  speeder). Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, the player has to
  navigate it through the pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and shooting
  at enemies on the way.

description:
  Super Chase H.Q. is an enhanced sequel to Chase H.Q. As usual, you must drive
  your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some
  crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped
  with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.
  .
  But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about.
  You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as
  cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent
  flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.
  .
  Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own.
  When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you
  if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have
  different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a
  missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your
  indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply
  when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out
  of time, the game ends.
  .
  When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are
  awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the
  number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the
  game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which
  can be viewed in between rounds.

  Young Morris Rolph has been trapped in limbo due to a malfunction on Dr
  Krankenpot's new teleport machine (how come characters with German-sounding
  names in computer games and films are always evil or stupid? Even Darth Vader
  sounds German.). Now he's been split into his 4 component parts, represented by
  liquid, gas, a hard ball and a bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels
  (36 on the special A1200 version - mirroring the game's plot-line of improved
  technology causing more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of the
  machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back to life.
  .
  The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by
  lots of points which can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps,
  thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level,
  although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and
  freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is
  done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in
  each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can't
  progress.

  Boy, did he pick a bad place to take  a nap.  Several hours out of port he woke

  only in cases of extreme medical emergency could the ship return to port.  And
  Lester wasn't that seasick.  Yet...

  So, he was along for the ride...  until the first port of call.  But as chance
  would have it, pirates hijacked and scuttled the freighter.  Luckily enough,
  Lester found a life vest before the ship sank and swam for the nearest tropical
  island.

  Just before reaching the beach Lester passed out from sheer exhaustion.  Now,
  his real adventure begins...

  Saibara Rieko no Mahjong Hourouki ("Rieko Saibara's Mahjong Travelogue",
  roughly) is a mahjong game for the Super Famicom that features the art of its
  namesake Rieko Saibara, a moderately famous manga artist that focuses on "slice

  characters.\n
  The game itself is a traditional four-player mahjong simulator: players aim to
  be the first to acquire a winning hand, winning a number of points from their
  opponents conditional on the quality of their tile combos.

  the anime and manga of the same name, which is usually localized as Legend of
  the Galactic Heroes. It is, however, the first and only game of the series to be
  released on the Super Famicom. The anime/manga series is known for its massive
  fleet-based skirmishes, its profuse amount of classical music and the Death
  Note-esque tactical rivalry between the two protagonists, Reinhard and Yang
  Wen-li: two military geniuses on either side of a centuries-old conflict.The
  SNES version is far more like a simulation than most games of this type, with
  players directing their fleet and combat from a computer console. The goal is
  effective macro-level management of the large number of ships under the player's
  command, rather than focusing on any one ship and its encounters.

  Blastris Mode features a variety of unrelated games.
  .
  1. Blastris A is a falling block game based on Tetris and plays very similar.
  Blocks appear on the left side of the screen and move towards the right side of
  the screen, where they will fit into play. The goal is to have the blocks on any
  column line up and destroy themselves. Each level requires five of these to
  happen. Unlike Tetris, the player cannot move or even rotate blocks. Instead
  each section of the block can be destroyed by shooting it. Higher difficulty
  levels increase the speed of gameplay\n
  2. Blastris B is a falling block game based on Columns and Puyo Puyo. On each
  screen are a number of "jelly blocks" which must be destroyed to complete the
  stage. New blocks appear at the top of the screen and move towards the bottom
  where they fit into play. Blocks can be destroyed by lining up a row of 4 blocks
  of the same colour. The player is unable to move the falling blocks but may
  cycle their colour by shooting at them.\n
  3. Mole Patrol is combination of Whack-a-Mole and a shooting gallery. A number
  of moles appear on the screen with a flag indicating the amount that need to be
  destroyed that level, before jumping into a pipe. From there the moles will
  climb out of any one of 12 holes on the screen and the player must shoot them as
  fast as possible. Along with regular moles are pink moles that will temporarily
  speed up gameplay, making shots more difficult.
  .
  LazerBlazer Mode feature a group of games set in a military atmosphere.
  .
  1. Type A: Intercept is a first person shooting game where the player shoots
  down incoming missiles and airplanes. These missiles/planes appear on the right
  side of the screen and move towards the left side. A radar is also given to the
  player to keep track of overall positions of these objects on the screen.
  Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each
  level.\n
  4. Type B: Engage is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down
  incoming missiles and airplanes, which will cautiously open fire on the player.
  These missiles/planes appear in front of the player, in the distance and move
  towards the player. The player has limited energy which is decreased when hit by
  an enemy. A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions
  of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot
  down a certain amount each level.\n
  5. Type C: Confront is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down
  incoming spacecraft, which will actively open fire on the player. These UFOs can
  appear anywhere on the screen and the player must shoot them down before they
  open fire on the player. Each hit by an enemy decreases the player's shield
  energy. A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions
  of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot
  down a certain amount each level.

  despite what the title may suggest, contained within are actually four different
  versions of Tetris: Tetris Classic, Familiss, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss. Tetris
  Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an
  endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest,
  is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is
  very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme
  and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a
  puzzle mode.
  .
  The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other
  version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by
  rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely
  out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are
  also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely
  from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color.
  There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these
  additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

  Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player
  battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.

  the Super Famicom. Its roster includes many of the major talents involved with
  the promotion in 1995.
  .
  It is named for and based on the Battle 7 NJPW event which was the 1995
  iteration of the January 4th show that the NJPW puts on every year at the Tokyo
  Dome. Battle 7 was the fourth iteration of the event. It would later be renamed
  a few times, but settled on Wrestling World in the early 2000s and later
  Wrestling Kingdom from 2007 to the present day.
  .
  The game includes a Battle 7 competition mode, which covers matches from the
  event, as well as a G1 Climax mode which is based on the August annual NJPW
  event of the same name. The game also includes standard Versus and Battle Royale
  modes, as well as a title match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship belt.
  Every event has a singles or tag option, except for Battle Royale which is a
  four-person free-for-all.

developer: Konami
publisher: Konami
description:
  Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '98: Basic Edition is a game of Baseball, where we
  take the role of the nice "pawapurokun", the little tubby baseball players found
  in all games of the series. The gameplay is classic but dreadfully accurate. In
  attack it is necessary to place and have a god like timing to get a good stroke
  of the bat. A rectangle is displayed in front of the batter delimiting the area
  in which the pitcher can place the ball without being at fault, and a small
  square, such as a viewfinder, shows the place where we will hit. At the top of
  the screen, a "mirror" view shows our batters face and behind him, the receiver
  of the opposing team. It is necessary to observe his glove to get an idea of
  where the pitcher will throw. In defense we will run, dive and quickly rethrow
  the ball in order to eliminate the opponents who managed to hit the ball. The
  game modes offer a classic championship with all the real professional teams of
  Japanese leagues and a scenario mode where we take a match in progress in a
  given situation. There is also an essential training mode to improve.

  Iseruhasa. Selios married his sweetheart Dina, and they had a child, whom they
  gave the name Atlas. At the age of fifteen, Atlas was already a strong warrior,
  thanks to the lessons of his teacher Lowel. Everything seemed peaceful in the
  country, until two warriors spotted strange creatures near the capital city.
  Those were... men in space suits! Of course, the warriors could not have known
  this and believed them to be monsters. Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful
  intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?

  gameplay-wise. The only major difference is the fact that the enemies are now
  completely visible on screen before battles, so that the player can avoid
  fighting them if he wants to. Otherwise, it is a traditional Japanese RPG with
  turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. The Genesis version has

  Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push
  crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not
  accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking
  Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is
  the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.
  .
  The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must
  perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so
  that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.
  .
  An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player
  must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum
  efficiency. The game was not released outside of Japan.

description:
  Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondoha Puzzle de Oshiokiyo is a falling block
  competitive puzzle game. Players begin by choosing from a selection of Sailor
  Moon licensed characters, each with a unique special attack. The player is
  presented with a board filled with colored blocks in three colors: red, blue and
  green. The goal is to remove all the blocks from play. Clicking on a block that
  touches several adjacent blocks of the same color will remove them all from
  play. As each player successfully clears blocks, they drop "black blocks" on
  their opponent as well as increase their power bar. Black blocks cannot be
  removed by normal means and disappear only when large ammounts of blocks are
  removed adjacent to them. As the power bar charges, players can unleash their
  special ability, often an attack on the other player.
  .
  This puzzle game is based on the "S" series of Sailor Moon and includes
  characters from there: Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars, Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury,
  Sailor Jupiter, Chibiusa, Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune and Sailor
  Pluto.

description:
  The date is Tuesday, September 13th, 1921.  It's a stormy night, and the luxury
  ocean liner "Lady Crithania" is about to be capsized by an enormous wave.  Many
  of its crew and its 2300 passengers will be killed outright in the initial
  overturning; in the transfigured catastrophic ship environment, most of the
  remainder will be unable to locate, reach and secure a safe exit from the
  sinking ship before it floods entirely.  Will you?
  .
  Inspired by Paul Gallico's 1969 novel The Poseidon Adventure, this game puts the
  player in the shoes of one of four denizens of the fated vessel: Capris Wisher,
  architect; Redwin Gardener, counselor; Luke Haines, sailor; or Jeffrey Howell,
  doctor.  Each of these gentlemen possess certain exclusive skills and distinct
  backstories and motivations -- a successful strategy toward winning the game
  will vary greatly depending on which character you initially select to play.
  And just how is the game won?
  .
  Here's a hint: don't be on the ship when it goes down for the last time.
  Accomplishing this demands mastery of a new skill hitherto untapped by its
  platform-game spiritual predecessors Prince of Persia and Flashback: exploring
  and navigating the ship in both an upright and an upside-down position, as well
  as many of the gradiated permutations between -- thanks to dizzying Mode 7
  abuse, the game environment will tip, tilt and skew at predictable (and
  predictably inconvenient) intervals, granting access to some hitherto
  unreachable areas (those doors at floor level are of little use when you're on
  the ceiling!) while denying access to other portions of the ship you perhaps
  intended to go back through.  You're going to need to recognize where you can
  and can't -- yet -- reach, and make a note to revisit when the pendulum swings
  the other way.
  .
  You're not going to make it out on your own.  A successful evacuation is going
  to require the assistance of other survivors.  Supposing you can find ( -- and
  reach!) them, you're still going to have to safely lead them past obstacles and
  hazards (as the ship flip-flops on its way to Davy Jones' Locker)... and as with
  all NPCs, they're slower and less agile than you, necessitating plotting out the
  simplest, safest course possible (... given the circumstances.)  Which of the
  endings you conclude with will be determined by who you rescue and how many of
  them there are -- but I'm sure you'll have your hands full the first few dozen
  play-throughs just staying alive and trying to figure out how to get to where
  you're supposed to be going.

  Did I mention there's a time limit of one measly hour?  For once, it's your
  friend; since your injury in this dangerous and unpredictable environment is so
  frequent and, indeed, inevitable, death has been replaced by a deduction of 5
  minutes from the time remaining -- but no matter how safe and dry a hidey-hole
  you manage to find, when the countdown reaches zero, it's game over.

description:
  Wil Mason has been transported to the fantasy world of Middlemere, which is
  ruled by four rival brothers. Wils aim is to find the secret to how he was
  transported here and discover a way back.
  .
  The gameplay consists of a combination of arcade elements and first person view
  much like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master.  One of the more remarkable
  features is in the first person mode, rather than having just 4 directs to face
  and flicking between them there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly
  as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the
  game more of a 3D feel.
  .
  The arcade elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight
  enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you encounter a
  similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional
  movement.

description:
  Idea no Hi ("Day of the Idea") is a surreal turn-based JRPG from Office Kukan
  and Shouei System. The manga artist Koji Aihara penned the story and worked on
  the character design. The protagonist is a player-named boy who escapes from a
  laboratory after awakening to his psychokinetic powers. His quest takes him
  across a dystopian world, picking up allies along the way.
  .
  The game has a few novel ideas, like allowing the protagonist to crossdress
  (which changes their profile picture) or wear underwear on his head, the latter
  of which results in people treating him like a pervert, which has a few
  beneficial side-effects. The protagonist has a "limit break" style attack when
  low on health, and the game has a day/night cycle.
  .
  Koji Aihara also worked on the 1992 JRPG Maka Maka (also by Office Koukan). His
  satirical and bizarre touches permeate Idea no Hi as well.

  Long ago, seven noble warriors defeated the ultimate evil, and brought peace to
  the world. But the memory of the humans is short... wars begin, breaking the
  world's harmony, and now the world is threatened by seven demons. Emperor Leon
  of Avalon tries to rid the world of the demons. One day, he goes on a treasure
  hunt, accompanied by his son and heir, Gerard. But the emperor is slain by a
  horrible monster, and now Gerard, the child of royal blood, has to continue his
  work.
  .
  In this game, you control the royal family of Avalon throughout several
  generations. Unlike the  first game, where you could play eight different
  characters from the very beginning of the game, here you play various characters
  continuously, generation after generation. Each time the old emperor passes
  away, you'll have to choose a heir for him out of four candidates. The choice of
  those candidates depends on chance and on your decisions to recruit party
  members during your reign. You'll learn various techniques during the game and
  then assign them to your party members (a party contains five active
  characters). Characters can die permanently, i.e., become unavailable for the
  rest of the game, in case they lose their life points; each time a character's
  HP reaches zero in battle, the character loses one life point.

  Battle mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante

  the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the
  energy of the opposing monster.  However, the Fighting Spirit system is present

  attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks.  Choosing the
  wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and

  Bust-A-Move (also known as Puzzle Bobble) is a real-time puzzle game in which
  the player controls a device called "pointer" at the bottom of the screen,
  aiming and releasing randomly colored bubbles upwards. Depending on the aiming,
  the bubbles may float up directly or bounce off the walls, changing their
  trajectory. The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch
  identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they
  pop and disappear from the screen.
  .
  If the ceiling of the area is covered by too many bubbles, it will gradually
  descend; the game is over when it nearly reaches the player-controlled pointer.
  Should the player fail to release the bubbles within a specific time limit, they
  will be released automatically, unaffected by the pointer's aiming.

  A two-player mode is included as well. Each player competes on an area occupying
  half of the screen, dealing with identically generated bubbles. Whenever a
  player successfully disposes of a bubble group, a part of it is transferred onto
  the opponent's part of the screen.

  The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every
  4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many
  years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful
  Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give
  place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the
  planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants.
  The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world.
  As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their
  separate yet intertwined quests.
  .
  Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become
  the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras
  soon complicates his training.
  .
  Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the
  Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a
  very important discovery regarding ancient ruins
  .
  Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was
  born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the
  world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.
  .
  Rundra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the
  better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they
  are able to  choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows
  any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time,
  allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless
  of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the
  overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search
  treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons,
  random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a
  side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters.
  Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items,
  defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning
  experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and
  items.
  .
  The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of
  syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents
  fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form.
  Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be
  arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints
  towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by
  talking to townspeople.

  strategy format reminiscent of Banpresto's Super Robot Wars series as well as
  many previous Gundam titles. The game doesn't have the standard system of one
  side moving all their units before switching control over to the opposing
  forces; instead, every unit has an active cooldown that the player can watch
  tick down as their next turn approaches. Some units are faster than others and

game: Spectre
file: Spectre (USA).zip
developer: Cybersoft
publisher: Cybersoft
description:
  Spectre is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts
  away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by
  it.
  .
  There is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and
  firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow
  and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both
  strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom
  variant.
  .
  Every level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several
  psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid
  trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either
  destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every
  level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful
  blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and
  flags throughout the level.
  .
  With every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire
  increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join
  the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo
  deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over
  shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first,
  third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into
  the battles.
  .
  The game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything
  after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.
  .
  An additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to
  eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial
  port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: Arena -
  free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.\n
  Flag Rally - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to
  get any flags being carried.\n
  Base Raid - Akin to "capture the flag".  Two teams, two bases; get match point
  for destroying opponent base.\n
  The CD-ROM manual includes a "Cyberpunk story", to give background information
  on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles
  in the Arena.

  In order to make it through successfully Bobby must get through with at least on
  heart remaining. Bobby can defeat enemies throughout the stages by throwing
  objects at them and can use Webbly to hang on and climb across wide pits.

  There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist
  Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has
  unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking,
  throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike
  most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your
  health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can
  triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and
  preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in
  two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots,
  but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while
  stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a

description:
  Night falls at the Smurf Village. Inquisitive Smurf brings Smurfette along to
  Papa Smurfs' laboratory to see the Magic Crystal that allows them to travel to
  anywhere in the world, but suddenly Smurfette breaks it, and they are gone! Now
  they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards
  of the Crystal and return home.
  .
  A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive
  Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect
  all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  There is a larger emphasis on
  exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them),
  so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with
  a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be
  obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario
  (ropes, or vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, improper contact
  with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is
  lost and the player must restart the level. Once all lives are lost, the game is
  over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small
  Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages
  there's a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end
  of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as
  possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills
  the meter, a 1-up is awarded.

  Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and
  inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan
  is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive
  things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his
  mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply
  confound his parents further.
  .
  Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based
  on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of
  five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific
  object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up
  simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in
  the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him,
  which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what
  he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.
  .
  Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a
  bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing

  was quickly ported to 3DO and Super Famicom the same year with different
  developer/publisher teams.
  .
  The game is based on an original video animation (OVA) that reimagines the
  Pacific Theater during World War 2 in which the Japanese navy had a significant
  advantage that would lead to a different outcome to the global conflict. This
  advantage is the eponymous submarine fleet, which proves to be almost
  unstoppable. The OVA was in turn inspired by a novel by Yoshio Aramaki of the
  same name.
  .
  The gameplay depicts each mission, taken from the OVA, as an isometric
  grid-based conflict between the player's forces and the enemy's fleet. In most
  scenarios, the enemy fleet belongs to the United States Navy. Different types of
  ships serve different applications in combat.

  Konami. It features the cast of the manga and anime Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai
  (usually localized as "Hang in There, Tsuyoshi") and Konami's own spin on Puyo
  Puyo: Taisen Puzzle-Dama ("Battle Puzzle Ball"). The goal of the game is to
  compete with a series of characters from Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai depending on
  who the player selected.
  .
  Play involves stacking duos of faces of various colors. If the player completes
  a set of three faces - they don't have to be lined up, but they do need to be
  adjacent - the faces disappear. If they are next to a "trapped" face it is
  transformed into a normal face block. Ideally, the player completes a
  three-strong stack of identical-colored trapped faces and frees them in groups
  of three, which will then lead to a chain as those three vanish and free more
  trapped faces.
  .
  The game was the first home console version of Konami's Taisen Puzzle-Dama
  series and the second game overall. The first version was the Arcade game Taisen
  Puzzle-Dama released earlier the same year. Future Taisen Puzzle-Dama games

game: Tintin : Prisoners of the Sun
file: Tintin - Prisoners of the Sun (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es).zip
developer: Infogrames
publisher: Infogrames
description:
  The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is based on the Belgian comic
  book of the same name. The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert
  Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue
  him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly
  based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.
  .
  The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the
  levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and
  security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself.
  This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their
  patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit.
  Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's
  perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can
  switch between the two at any time.

  decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless
  discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help.
  But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm.
  They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants
  murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible
  massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for
  his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle
  who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to
  much more remote places than that!
  .
  "Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in
  common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward
  and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled
  by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an
  overall strategy for your allies.

description:
  Kawa no Nushi Tsuri 2 ("Fishing the River Master 2") is a Japan-exclusive
  fishing RPG from Natsume and the third game in their long-running Nushi
  Tsuri/River King franchise. Like its predecessor, released on the Famicom in
  1990, the game crosses fishing game elements such as finding bait and ideal
  fishing spots with RPG elements such as fighting wildlife in turn-based battles
  and growing more experienced over time. Cash and XP earned while fishing or
  roaming around contribute to the player's angling ability.
  .
  The player can select one of four family members, a trademark of the series.
  Each character has slightly different goals, but they usually culminate in
  becoming a strong enough fisherperson to catch "the River King": a legendary
  freshwater fish.
  .
  Though the game is labelled as Kawa no Nushi Tsuri 2, the second game in the
  series was actually the 1992 game Kawa no Nushi Tsuri: Shizenha for the PC
  Engine.

developer: NCS Corporation

description:
  "Der Langrisser" is a sequel to the game that was known outside of Japan as
  Warsong, and is in fact a remake of the Genesis game  Langrisser II.
  .
  The Blue Dragon Knights of the Rayguard Empire are trying to steal the virtuous
  sorceress Riana. Their goal is to make her serve the evil Emperor Bozel, whose
  intention is to find the most powerful evil sword in the land, the Alhazard.
  Naturally, the main hero of the game, the knight Elwin, has not only to rescue
  Riana, but to retrieve the legendary holy sword Langrisser, the only artifact
  that is more powerful than Alhazard. At first, Elwin automatically follows the
  "good" path, but as the game progresses, he can choose whether to continue being
  good, to become an ally with Rayguard, or to side with the forces of Chaos whose
  goal is utter destruction.
  .
  "Der Langrisser" features a complex character creation process, during which you
  must answer morally ambiguous questions,  Ultima-style, that will determine the
  class and the attributes of the main hero. The game is a strategy RPG in which
  you control your party only during battles. You just hire soldiers and unite
  them under commands of generals. When your units attack the enemy, an automatic
  battle sequence occurs. You can also use magic spells to heal your troops or to
  harm enemy soldiers.

game: Soul Blazer
file: Soul Blazer (USA).zip
developer: Enix
publisher: Enix
description:
  You have been called by the Master to restore life to the Friel empire.  The
  ruler, King Magridd, struck a deal with the evil Deathtoll - in exchange for the
  soul of one living being, Deathtoll will give him a piece of gold.  Magridd's
  greed got the better of him, and, thinking of the millions of souls of every
  living creature around the world, readily agreed to the deal.  But Magridd
  himself has since disappeared, and the the land is now devoid of life - instead
  only filled with Deathtoll's monstrous minions.  Will you be able to save
  Friel's subjects from their horrible fate?
  .
  Soul Blazer is an action RPG in the top-down style of The Legend of Zelda.  Like
  Zelda, battles are not turn-based - the player directly attacks enemies and
  dodges them.  As they progress, they also unlock special items which allows them
  to complete tasks for characters or access special areas (such as the Dream Rod,
  which transports you into someone's - or something's - dream).  Unlike Zelda,
  the game has an experience meter, and the player levels up and becomes stronger
  as they defeat enemies.  The game's unique hook is that there are "Monster
  Lairs" spread all over the land of Friel.  When they destroy all the enemies in
  a lair, they don't come back, and when they step on the empty lair, it restores
  part of the game world, bringing back anything from plants, to animals, to
  people, to buildings and more.  Each restored soul helps in some way - for
  example, the player can climb regrown ivy to reach new areas, reunite families
  by bringing back husband and wife, rebuild cities by restoring architects, and
  talk to characters to complete even more quests.
  .
  The player's main goal is to find six Stones, which allow them to gain access to
  the World of Evil, where Deathtoll resides.  These stones are guarded by key
  characters in different parts of the world, usually the rulers, who require the
  player to defeat a boss character to rescue them.  While most of the game allows
  them to progress in a linear fashion, there are certain souls that can only be
  restored by killing monsters that can't be harmed with their earlier weapons.
  The player will need to find special weaponry and then backtrack to previous
  areas to rescue these souls.  It's also advisable to revisit previous locations,
  as certain characters may have new sidequests to complete which can reward them
  with new items to make them even stronger.

  GT Racing is a Super Famicom racing video game where the player gets to drive a
  Gran Turismo car in either championship or practice mode.  The game is based on
  the 1996 Super GT racing season using the horsepower standards and rules of the
  era.
  .
  During championship mode, the player is asked enter a number, his or her
  driver's name, and the team name that he or she will use during the
  championship. The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or
  Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his
  or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the
  number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine
  seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the
  double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks,
  including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole
  Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount
  Fuji in the background).
  .
  Versus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the
  players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to
  fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity
  to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course.
  Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of
  nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus
  automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for
  supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile
  is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo
  championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself.
  .
  The "free practice" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by
  him/herself for up to ten laps. Acquiring damage is still possible either
  crashing into walls or through normal wear and tear. The fastest lap time gets
  captured for the record book just like in the other modes of the game. Before
  being able to practice freely, the player can also choose the weather condition
  and the setup of his vehicle

  1979 computer game Heiankyo Alien. It also includes a recreation of the original
  1979 game configured to work with the SNES controller. The game remains the
  same: the player, as a Heian-era policeman, must dig pits to catch carnivorous
  aliens and then bury them to destroy them. It takes three steps to dig a pit big
  enough, and aliens will quickly fill holes that aren't large enough. If an alien
  catches the policeman, he will be eaten.
  .
  The enhanced version adds wooden blocks that can be chopped down, but this takes
  as long as digging pits and puts the player in peril during the time it takes to
  remove them. The game also includes a two player versus mode that gives each
  player half the screen. When an alien is removed from one player's side, it
  appears on the other player's side, so players must quickly remove aliens so
  they don't get overwhelmed by the sheer numbers.

  the story mode, the player takes on a series of monsters. The monster
  intermittently casts spells at the player that randomly transforms blocks into

  RPG battles. The money can be spent on acquiring new items, and these items can

  game. Considered an expert on youkai and Japanese mythological creatures, Mizuki
  is perhaps better known as the creator of the GeGeGe no Kitarou franchise.

  The Cho Aniki series makes it's debut on the SNES with all of it's homo-erotic,
  pseudo humorous, bizarre, sweaty bodybuilding charm, but with one major gameplay
  change. Instead of being another side-scrolling shooter, Bakuretsu Rantouden is

  recognizable characters from the Cho Aniki series (yes the speedo wearing
  bodybuilders included) fight each other for ultimate supremacy using special
  attacks and moves.

  instead of being restricted to walking backwards and forwards in the 2D plane
  and jumping around as in other fighting games, in this game all the characters
  can fly meaning the fights actually occur in mid-air allowing the players to
  dash all over the screen. Includes single player and 2-player vs modes.

  down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan

  solitaire rules, but in order to do so they have to store matching tiles along
  the bottom of the screen. The player's "hand" has a limited number of slots
  available, and if the player fills it up with pieces that don't match then they
  have failed. There is also a timer for the whole round that ticks down whenever
  the player is deliberating on their next move, and removing pairs of pieces from
  play will slightly refill it. There are also special power-up tiles that
  increase the timer.
  .
  As with mahjong solitaire, the player can only match identical tiles. The
  exception are the eight unique season and flower tiles, which can be paired off
  with any other season or flower (though it has to be two seasons or two

game: Timecop
file: Timecop (USA).zip
developer: Cryo Interactive
publisher: Cryo Interactive
description:
  Based off of the Jean Claude Van Damme film Timecop, this game acts as a sequel
  of sorts. We learned well from the film that the power time travel affords
  corrupts all men weaker than the Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to
  the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims himself dictator of the
  universe, captures Van Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in the
  film, and challenges him to a "duel across time." Platforming action follows
  across multiple periods of history.
  .
  The primary feature of this game is its digitized characters, uncommon for
  console games of that era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen and stills
  were taken from the video to create all characters and their animations. The
  effect is impressive for the SNES, though it does result in robotic enemies who
  do not respond well to being punched or kicked. The "timing,", both in terms of
  controlling your character and fighting with enemy characters seems off through
  the entire game.
  .
  There are 15 levels in total, most of which are standard fighting platform
  levels. Three basic fighting moves are available to the character, not including
  jumping and crouching kicks, and not including the use of a gun with extremely
  limited ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the game culminates in a
  jetpack duel over Los Angeles with the villainous time travel creator fellow.
  .
  The game also featured some rare use of digital voice, primarily in the "FBI...
  Get on it!" background theme in the first few levels.

  Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou: Dokidoki Seishun Hen ("Great Burst of Laughter
  Theater Life: The Heart-Pounding Adolescence Chapter") is the second Super
  Famicom game in the Bakushou Jinsei Gekijou franchise and the fifth game

  that plays similarly to Milton Bradley's The Game of Life, known as the Jinsei
  Game in Japan.
  .
  Unlike Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou, which carried the player from infancy to
  retirement age, Dokidoki Seishun Hen focuses entirely on highschoolers. The goal
  is to learn as much knowledge as possible, earn plenty of money and make their
  teachers and parents happy. Instead of having a target square to reach in order
  to continue onto the next phase of the game, the players simply move around a
  circular board experiencing events every turn as weeks and months pass, with new
  elements and new areas of the board added after certain dates.

  Shonen Jump superhero manga Tottemo! Lucky Man, about an incredibly unfortunate
  schoolkid who gets crushed by an alien craft and merges with the intergalactic
  hero Lucky Man.
  .
  Similar to something like Dokapon, the game is an RPG framed as a board game: To
  move Lucky Man, the player must hit a button that stops a roulette that
  determines how many spaces he can travel. Certain results occur depending on
  where Lucky Man ends his turn, from gaining bonus items to talking to NPCs to a
  combat situation. Combat plays out like a turn-based RPG, and Lucky Man with his
  fellow heroes Shouriman (Victory Man) and Yuujouman (Friend Man) fight against
  various unusual enemies. The goal of the game is to rescue Lucky Man's love
  interest Mit-chan from a mysterious kidnapper.

  must enter the dreamworld, defeat the demon and rescue the nobility.
  .
  Yume Meiky?: Kigurumi Daib?ken is a first-person dungeon crawler with
  step-movement and random encounters that plays like a simplified version of the
  Dungeon Master series template, albeit with a turn-based engine. One of the main
  differences is the presentation: instead of the usual dank and dark dungeon with
  grim walls covered by rusty chains, this game has surfaces made of cake and
  candy. Instead of skeletons and orcs as enemies, it features furry and cute
  anthropomorphic animals. Once defeated, these creatures occasionally leave
  behind their skin, which the hero can collect and wear for a change in
  statistics and new abilities. They also sometimes drop candy, the game's
  currency. There are several shops on each level: a tailor shop to change and
  store skins (it is possible to carry a maximum of six skins), shops for potions
  and health boosts, etc.
  .
  When a random enemy encounter occurs, a menu with the options of fighting or
  escaping appears. After choosing to fight, another menu pops up, which includes
  the commands Punch, Kick, Talent, Defend, and Item. After choosing either of the
  first two the player is presented with a grid where an icon (a fist or a foot)
  can be positioned over a part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic
  element to the game, as different enemies have different weak spots that can be
  exploited. The Talent option accesses the special ability that a skin may
  possess.

  A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, Math Blaster: In Search of Spot
  is an educational title with arcade elements designed to help students learn
  maths while having fun.
  .
  The game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals,
  percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced
  separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like
  the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets
  (present in the PC version only).
  .
  Math Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien
  at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the
  mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.
  .
  The game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of a
  series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games)
  strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately,
  for practice or for score.
  .
  The activities are as follows:
  .
  1. Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the
  tractor beam to collect space trash.
  .
  2. Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around
  columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash
  you collected into fuel.
  .
  3. Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a
  number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each
  side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling
  from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are
  also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels,
  monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.
  .
  4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship displays an equation, and the four
  portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the
  correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship.
  Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs
  where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time
  limit.
  .
  Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate
  that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a
  high score board for their account.

  Ryo Shizima or Maria Tobari, two demon hunters who must save an innocent girl

  the same stages; only single-player mode is available.
  .
  Both demon hunters rely mostly on close-range attacks - Ryo with a sword, Maria
  with a whip, though they can also use guns. Most of the gameplay consists of
  slowly walking through monster-infested areas, eliminating enemies and avoiding
  obstacles, which often requires jumping and ducking. Power-ups are obtained from
  fallen foes. Depending on their color, these power-ups can increase the attack
  level of a weapon, envelop the character in a protective force field, or restore
  his/her health. Rare red power-ups are unique to each character: Ryo dons a
  special armor that hits enemies with bouncing lasers, while Maria gets in touch
  with her angelic nature, growing wings and firing homing energy balls.

  and number attached to them, and drop them into a grid with other fallen dice.
  If a die is on a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with another die of
  the same color, both those dice and every die in-between will drop by one in
  value. Once a die has reached "1" and is involved in another combo, it
  disappears. Dice on top fall in the gaps left behind, potentially creating chain
  reactions. There are also power-ups that will either help the player out or
  create problems for the opponent. The game ends once the dice stack to the top

  skills accuired during the game, who then perform actions based on those
  commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one
  side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.

publisher: Sony Imagesoft
description:
  Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name.
  Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash
  dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight
  standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding
  on the Sega CD) from avalanches.
  .
  Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives
  the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal
  with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the
  screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The
  available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and
  the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.
  .
  The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by,
  scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge
  systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.

  what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew

  firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous
  journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get
  involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle
  against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!
  .
  "Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs.
  You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to
  the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go
  next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot
  leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to
  the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You
  navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and
  long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points.
  Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately
  after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the
  "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up
  automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain
  locations.
