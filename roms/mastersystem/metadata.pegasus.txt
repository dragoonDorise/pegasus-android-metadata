game: Ultimate Soccer
file: Ultimate Soccer (Europe, Brazil) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip
developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed)
  international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and
  strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament,
  playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one
  of them must be completed in one sitting.
  .
  The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key
  aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight
  (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be
  deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are
  slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and
  momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also
  included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a
  lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes
  from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.
  .
  Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D
  effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted
  down to show more of the field.
  .
  The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on
  PC, Saturn and PlayStation.

description:
  Bram Stroker's Dracula is a side-scroller platform game loosely based on the
  1992 film of the same name. Players take the role of Jonathan Harker whose
  mission to to destroy Count Dracula by first heading to Transylvania and then
  London.
  .
  Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most
  basic of which is a knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker's
  health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon.
  Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be
  found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration,
  timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a
  shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas
  and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the "Daytime" and the
  "Nighttime". These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and
  1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor
  enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded
  by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.

description:
  The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the
  Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she
  can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of
  skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his
  pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.
  .
  Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game.
  The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can
  be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System
  version).
  .
  The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit
  head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads
  with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a
  bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove
  piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's
  playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face
  several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled
  to the top.

description:
  The evil wizard Zaks has cast a spell on the peaceful Yolkfolk, and while many
  fell under his spell, others have other problems to deal with, including Dizzy,
  who saw his girlfriend Daisy kidnapped and taken hostage by Zaks, and it's up to
  him to restore the Yolkfolk to normal and rescue Daisy from the top of the Cloud
  Castle's tower.
  .
  The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was
  the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the
  only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on,
  the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games,
  such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone.
  .
  Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using
  them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along
  the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a
  limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's
  puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the
  gates of the tower.

  You're about to inherit the family jewels. If you can get to them, that is.
  .
  They're hidden inside the haunted mansion, which wouldn't be such a big deal if
  it weren't infested with Draculas, Bats, Fire Blowers, Mummies, and other deadly
  weirdos. You'll have to ward off or destroy everything that gets in your way --
  no matter how grotesque it appears. Furthermore, you'll have to keep punching
  your way through the mansion until you find the secret key. You then have to use
  it to open one of the five coffins, defeat Dracula, capture the jewel he drops,
  and make your way out of the mansion.
  .
  You play the role of Mick, and everything is going to stop you from completing
  these tasks and making you way out of the mansion. You just have to punch, or
  jump on, your enemies to defeat them. And arrows will be flying from either
  direction and will attempt to hit you on the head, and you must either duck or
  jump on them for extra points. You can jump or touch lights to freeze everything
  on screen for a few seconds. Rather than punching, you can collect a sword on
  the lower level by jumping on it as it flies past you. The sword is useful when
  you fight Dracula or getting rid of Fire Blowers.
  .
  You start the game with three lives, and receive an additional life every 50,000
  and 150,000 points. You also have an energy meter. You lose energy when you
  touch one of the monsters. When you run out of energy, you lose a life. You gain
  energy by collecting treasures scattered throughout the mansion, and it is
  restored when you kill a Dracula.

game: Golfamania

developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Golfamania is a golfing simulation game where players play on an 18 hole golf
  course with all the rules and scoring like in the real game.
  .
  Within the game there are 4 different modes to play on that includes Practice,
  Match Play, Stroke Play, and Pro Tournament. In Practice a single player can
  play any of the 18 holes available. Match Play is 2 player mode against human or
  computer. Stroke Play is the player can play up to 4 others that can include 1
  computer player. In this mode the character skill can increase in 3 different
  areas that are power, accuracy, and luck with the 6 different characters
  available. The main mode is the Pro Tournament and it is where the player plays
  against over 30 computer players (all playing different holes) with the
  objective to score lower than the other players (as per the rules of golf).
  Based on performance the player can earn experience points (XP) that they can
  use to upgrade the power, accuracy, and luck of the character for future
  tournaments. Some of the holes have awards like ‘longest drive’ and ‘hole in
  one’ awards that can earn bonus XP.
  .
  Regardless of the mode the game is played in the same sort of way. The player
  selects a character (the selection depends on the mode) and then sets up the
  character by naming and picking their style.  In all modes but Practice the
  player must pick 3 golf clubs that they must remove from their selection of 17
  different clubs (1-5 wood, 1-9 Iron, Pitching Wedge, Sand Wedge, and Putter).
  When playing the player is presented with a top down view where the player lines
  up the shot and the location on the golf ball they want to hit (for spin). Then
  the player selects the club they want to use (all go varying distances). When
  that is all done the player must play the skill part of the game, where they are
  presented with a power bar that has a marker that going is up and down along it.
  The player must stop the marker on the red area in the centre of the power bar
  to get a good hit (with the center been a perfect hit)and if this area is missed
  the ball will only travel about 20 yards (compared to about 100+ yards of a good
  hit). The amount of red that is on the power bar depends on the golf club used.
  To help the player the distance of the shot can be lowered in exchange for a
  lower marker speed and can be used for shots closer to the hole (very helpful
  for putter shots). The game uses battery backed RAM save to continue play later.

  The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world
  governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a
  dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in
  football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual
  presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts
  introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a
  market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.
  .
  Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in
  each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how
  good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides
  can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer
  operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges
  quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set
  pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and
  then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be
  selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these
  combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders,
  midfielders and strikers cover.

  oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk
  through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes
  through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants,
  like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and
  octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against
  these menaces.
  .
  There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't
  be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission.
  During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets,
  skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the
  skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant.
  When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the
  next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality
  will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms,
  potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs,
  there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death
  will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At
  the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his
  fireballs or lightning bolts.
  .
  There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see,
  warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a
  special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a
  pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear
  and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as
  you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected
  all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often
  than not, you'll get further in the round.

  James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing is a boxing simulation featuring the
  former world heavyweight boxing champion (replaced with the fictional S. Davis
  in the European version). The game is not to be confused with the Genesis title
  of the same name, which is an entirely different game. Instead this title is
  completely identical to the Game Gear and Master System versions of George
  Foreman's KO Boxing, to which it served as a basis, only with George Foreman
  instead of James Douglas and reworked by Sims Co., Ltd., a spin-off of the
  original Sanritsu team.
  .
  The player is cast as James Douglas to go through a series of boxing matches
  against different opponents to win the championship title belt. The boxers are
  shown from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid
  punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be
  varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no
  regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points,
  provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be
  pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or
  fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.
  .
  Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be
  charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the
  back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the
  ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won
  match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three
  characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.

  of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him

  While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast
  Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the
  Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself.
  He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a
  ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife
  descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.\n
  As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at
  the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors
  took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge
  his father and redemption would be hard.
  .
  Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit
  computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax
  scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic
  cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing
  between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate
  through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and
  activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a
  sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump
  and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just
  one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also
  traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump,
  duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit
  points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level
  (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to
  the difficulty level.

  ingredients: bat's blood, Saci's hat, Curupira's salsaparrilha bat, Iara's hair
  and a tear from Cuca. To make things even worse, next night will be a full moon,
  and if Tia Nastácia doesn't get cured until then, she'll sleep for 100 years!
  So, Pedrinho (Pete) and Emília (Emily) are sent to bring the ingredients and
  cure Tia Nastácia.

  Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch in English) is based on the
  works of Monteiro Lobato, a Brazilian writer. One or two players (in hot-seat
  mode) can choose to play either the boy Pedrinho (or Pete, in the English
  version of the books) or the rag doll Emília (Emily in the English version). The
  items they must gather are based on Brazilian folklore.
  .
  Gameplay consists in basic side-scrolling/platforming. Either characters can
  jump (button 2), run (either pressing the D-pad twice to a direction, or holding
  a button and the D-pad to a direction), shoot (button 1), and duck. The game has
  four levels (one for each ingredient, the last one with two of them), all set in
  the ranch, with indoor levels, underwater levels, caves and such.
  .
  Each character starts with 3 lives. They have a health bar, which can be
  replenished by gathering items such as nests with eggs, or by freeing birds from
  cages. The enemies faced are most animals, such as bats, bugs, spiders, snakes,
  piranhas, jaguars and monkeys.

  The story of Mio begins as you, finally having gone on holidays, arrive on the

  decide to buy a present for her. You visit a shady foreign man's shop and buy an
  egg that he promises will hatch a cute pet. When Laila sees the egg, she
  recognizes it as a Mio egg, Mios being a rare animal that is thought to be
  extinct. Since you gave her the egg, it is your responsibility to find out how
  you keep a Mio. Still, the fact that you have a Mio egg should not be known to
  everyone, since scientists will be very keen to take the animal from you for
  purposes of their studies.
  .
  Your quest for the well-being, and eventual mystery, of the Mio animal takes you
  on a quest across several planets, not too far from the planet system of
  Phantasy Star. The game is controlled using an interface popular in Japanese
  adventures of the eighties, mostly identical with ICOM's interface used in
  adventures from the same era, such as Shadowgate or Déjà vu. You can talk to
  people in the game by deciding whom to talk to and the topic, but these
  interrogations have little in common with the more interactive LucasArts
  adventures. Finding out things is often a matter of repeatedly asking, asking at
  the right moment or in the right order. Battery-backed up RAM is not used for
  saving, instead you are given a password when quitting.

  Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working
  late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot,
  thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from
  his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up
  to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating
  plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle -
  workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and
  rescue his dad!
  .
  The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the
  player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the
  basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle,
  whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon
  is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at
  them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down
  the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread
  throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special
  skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby
  Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy
  Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.
  .
  Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and
  raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several
  entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the
  Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point
  reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing
  your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies.
  The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely
  missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.

  choppers, and submarines who will launch missiles or rockets at you. If you are
  hit by any of these, damage is inflicted to the submarine, but you can shoot
  down any of the missiles or rockets. You will need to keep an eye on the
  built-in radar and sonar to find out where enemies will hit next. Your fuel is
  limited, and can be increased by destroying certain enemies. The game ends when
  your submarine is destroyed or you run out of fuel.

  figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited
  selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country.
  This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and
  they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed,
  the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal
  characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to
  dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order
  to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they
  have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members,

  This game is a basic shoot-em-up, but instead of destroying space ships and
  aliens, the player must destroy the scientists' facilities and clean up the
  lagoon, by destroying the trash in it – the lagoon is filled with matches, eaten
  apples, cotton swabs, boots and other kinds of junk.

  Sapo Xulé's ship can be upgraded by collecting leaves (which will make it
  faster) and flies inside bubbles (which will improve its fire power). There are
  also satellite weapons that can be attached to the ship.

  challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of
  which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who
  progresses.
  .
  You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They
  consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and
  frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and
  tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or
  freeze the opponents.
  .
  The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the
  ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can
  sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars
  which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier
  activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the
  same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the
  stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the
  pitch, in the direction it was going.
  .
  You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear
  on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either
  on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better
  ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved
  to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use
  of them is important.

  A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your
  team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

  Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.
  .
  Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the
  80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button
  mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the
  action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in
  swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button
  touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially
  faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top
  half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.\n
  Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the
  action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial
  mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the
  action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical
  event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being
  the one with the highest score on all three rounds.

  The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France,
  Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the
  Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of
  athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform
  differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World
  Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The
  competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the

  It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling\n
  with his friend and neighbor Barney.\n
  Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the
  living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping.\n

  quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living
  squirrel.\n

  scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then
  he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles

  speed of the ball and the starting position of the player.\n
  Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game\n
  takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.
  .
  Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.\n
  On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma
  find that out!\n
  Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some\n
  scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.\n

  Game Box Série Esportes Radicais (which means Game Box Radical Sports Series) is
  a modified version of California Games. Four of its six events were removed and
  now the player can only compete in the Surfing and BMX events. The team
  selection (sponsorship) was also removed, as well as the ability of naming your
  players. Each player will get a default name (PLAY1, for instance), and the game
  will select teams in order (player 1 gets Maxx-Out, player 2 gets Costa del Mar,
  and so on). The trophy screens were also removed, so the player don't see the
  team logo on it. He only knows in which team he is during the event competition,
  when his name and team appears on the top of the screen.
  .
  Up to eight players can take turns competing in either one of the two events, or
  both. They can also choose to practice in one single event.
  .
  In the Surfing event, the player must perform maneuvers on the wave as trying to
  keep as much time as he can inside the tube, or jumping off and on the wave. He
  can speed up his board by climbing and descending the wave, and can slow it down
  by holding button 2 while maneuvering. When his time runs out, the judges will
  tell him his score.
  .
  In the BMX event, the player must perform jumps and maneuvers while trying to
  complete the course. He can speed up his bike by pressing button 1 repeatedly
  and jump by pressing button two. While in the middle of a jump, pressing
  different directions on the d-pad will make the biker perform different kinds of
  jumps. The more dangerous the maneuver, the more points he gets. If he crashes
  three times, he's eliminated.

  Vampires' population in Transilvania has increased a lot lately, and there's not

  Chapolim X Drácula: Um Duelo Assustador (which translates Chapolim vs. Dracula:
  A Frightening Duel) is an authorized "hack" of Ghost House, with Ghost House's
  hero, Mick, replaced by Chapolim (or El Chapulín Colorado in original Spanish),
  a famous Mexican character from a TV series. Chapolim is a parody to superheroes
  in general. He dresses a red grasshopper costume with a yellow heart in the

  Chillón in the original, Squeaky Mallet in English) a red (toy) hammer.
  .
  At each stage, Chapolim must defeat five vampires that are in torpor within
  their coffins. The coffins are locked, so he must first find the keys to unlock
  them. He'll find the keys killing the most diverse enemies that haunt the
  mansion he's in, such as ghosts, bats, fire blowers, mummies, etc. Once he's got
  a key, he must unlock a coffin and then defeat the vampire who sleeps there.

  In order to kill his enemies, Chapolim can jump over them or punch them. Every
  once in a while, his Marreta Biônica will come flying from one side of the
  screen to another, and if he jumps over it, he'll catch it. Chapolim can also
  punch the lights of the mansion: they'll flash and paralyze his enemies.

  Chapolim starts with 3 lives and no continues. He'll be healed by collecting
  treasures through the castle, and will gain additional lives at every 50,000 and

developer: U.S. Gold
publisher: U.S. Gold
description:
  This game is based closely on Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.  It combines a
  number of gameplay styles, but primarily it is a side scrolling run-and-jump
  platformer.
  .
  The game begins on Tatooine, where you, as Luke Skywalker, must travel around
  and meet up with R2D2, C3PO, Obi-Wan, and so on. Eventually, you travel through
  Mos Eisley and the Death Star as well.  While most of the game has you
  controlling Luke, Han or Leia directly, some of the various game styles include
  a first-person Millennium Falcon asteroid belt sequence, and an overhead view
  Death Star trench run.

description:
  Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are
  nothing unusual. Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting
  bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games
  of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are
  particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous
  examples.
  .
  Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck
  called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to
  fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with
  boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to
  clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches.

description:
  Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen
  Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2
  as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once
  enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's
  extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's
  souls.
  .
  A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat
  champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and
  Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former
  Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors
  are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female
  Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.
  .
  Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level
  playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and
  "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a
  code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities
  and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the
  Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.
  .
  Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the
  series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and
  introduces online network play to the PC version.

  through the Garden, Down Town, the Forest, Rock Mountain, and finally ending up
  in the Nursery.

  Jerry will do anything he can to keep Tom from snagging him. Even if that means
  running through dangerous areas. Tom must try and dodge tail-scorching stoves,
  dropping flower pots, falling boulders, and even climb skyscrapers and swim
  underwater all while trying to nab that rascally rodent. Not only that, Jerry
  will also throw bombs and leave land mines in Tom's path.
  .
  Be careful, if Jerry gets too far ahead and out of site, the game is lost. But,
  if Tom is able to get close enough, he can pounce on Jerry resulting in an
  advance the next level. The next level can also be reached to by chasing Jerry
  to the end of the round where he will be cornered. There are also damage points
  that are taken away from Tom as he is hit by the number of dangerous
  environments around him. Too many hits will also result in a game over. It is
  just another hard days work for Tom the cat!

game: R-Type
file: R-Type (World).zip
developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and
  strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch
  effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.
  .
  The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the
  smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire
  button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy,
  eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods
  will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade.
  The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons
  pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any
  enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them.
  You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in.
  Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both
  as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in
  order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking
  missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their
  colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across
  the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow
  one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).
  .
  The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R.
  Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered
  trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other
  shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is
  exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the
  screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the
  levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the
  memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

  There are three main modes:
  .
  1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race
  followed by three laps.
  .
  2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the
  championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular
  season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have
  roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist.
  There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive
  SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player
  must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner
  of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer
  in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too
  many objects or other cars frequently.
  .
  3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for
  championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just
  the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having
  to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps
  (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or
  wet, only on some circuits).
  .
  While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same:
  Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or
  Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers. The car can be
  instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.

  As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter
  based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through
  future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human
  resistance.
  .
  Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate
  (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers
  in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage.
  Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the
  machine guns, and are shot to be collected.
  .
  T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general
  concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns
  down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a
  besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy
  supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time
  to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet
  research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend
  off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.
  .
  Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold
  Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final
  battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns
  (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

  shmup code even once more. Typically, the scrolling is choppy here, too. There
  have been several other small compromises, but overall Wonsiin is a decent port
  of the Knightmare inspired game. Especially some elements that one would think
  would have been sacrificed on the MSX, most impressively the attacking dinosaur
  skeletons, are intact. Still, Wonsiin ends after three stages, leaving out the
  final challenges.

  This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's
  classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on
  one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special
  squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on
  the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many
  entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to
  popular British sports.
  .
  Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions
  against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five
  human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes'
  or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.
  .
  The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two
  different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology -
  some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of
  music.
  .
  One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis
  of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into
  the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player
  within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when
  choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.

  Many centuries ago, on the planet Aries, there lived a boy called Alex Kidd. For
  seven years, he lived on Mt. Eternal studying Shellcore, an ancient art that
  makes one strong enough to break rocks into pieces. As he was leaving the
  mountain one day to travel to his spiritual homeland, a dying man told him that
  the peaceful city of Radactian was in grave danger. Before taking his last
  breath, the man gave Alex a piece of a map and a medallion made of Sun Stone.
  .
  There are eleven locations in which Alex must explore, each of them has its own
  unique dangers. In each location, Alex can collect bags of coins, which can be
  used to buy items at the shop and are used to help Alex get through each
  location (eg: motorcycle, peticopter, power bracelet, etc.) There are also traps
  that Alex must avoid like the ghost that chases him. He can also collect the
  Telepathy Ball that will help him read people's minds.
  .
  Later, Alex learns that in order to save Radactian from destruction, he must
  first defeat Janken the Great, Emperor of the planet Janbarik (he got his name
  from his expertise at the game of Janken -- or what people call "scissors,
  paper, stone" in the Western World. Janken has sent his henceman all over
  Radactian to prepare the game for Alex as he passes by them. In order to get
  past them, Alex must win three times at Janken. If he loses, he is turned to
  stone and vanished from Radactian forever. Later on in the game, Alex must play
  with the same henceman, but only this time, when Alex wins, they decide to play
  dirty.
  .
  Alex uses his fists to wipe out some of Janken's enemies such as birds, sea
  horses, bats, monkeys, frogs, and a few others. If his quest to save Radactian
  from the evil hands of Janken becomes difficult, he can instead use the power
  bracelet to perform the "Shocking Waves of Destruction", an ancient trick in the
  art of Shellcore.
  .
  Before Alex comes face-to-face with Janken, he should rescue his brother, Egle,
  from imprisonment, and get the letter and two medallions.

  of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part
  of the movie.
  .
  As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on
  them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every
  time you roar, you have to wait for your "roar meter" to charge.
  .
  As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by
  slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab
  them and toss them off the screen).
  .
  The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the
  beginning every time.

  Arcade translation of Sega's SDI.  You pilot a satellite in outer space.  Your
  job: To destroy alien attackers who are waging a nuclear war against planets in
  the solar system, including Earth and even the moon!  What's unique about this
  title, is the satellite and your primary weapon move independently of each
  other.  Position your satellite too far away from the action and the bullets
  take too long to hit your target.  It's a good balance between dodging objects
  crucial to your survival and shooting down the enemy targets.  If the planet
  takes too much damage, you lose.  There are both Offensive and Defensive battle
  modes.  There is also a 2-player mode where you and a friend can team up, one
  controlling the satellite and the other controlling the weapon making this a
  multiplayer game as well.

description:
  From Sega 8-bit specialists Aspect comes one of many adaptations of Tim Burton's
  1992 superhero sequel Batman Returns. Like other versions, it is a
  side-scrolling platformer. While very similar to the Game Gear version, the
  Master System version has slightly different levels and gameplay mechanics.
  .
  Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These
  include the streets and rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store,
  the sewers, and the Penguin's lair. For the first four levels, a route can be
  selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game.
  .
  Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at
  them. At the beginning, the weapon's range is very limited, but it can be
  expanded by collecting powerups. Other tools Batman can use are a grappling hook
  to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his
  cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.
  .
  Unlike in the Game Gear version, there is no health bar: a single hit will kill
  Batman. To compensate, the game contains a generous amount of extra lives.

  several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs
  automatically, but must be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and
  barrels, evade falling objects and avoid getting caught by a guard. Other levels
  are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches
  to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown
  to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are
  also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls

developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who
  will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear
  accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and
  transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly
  become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased.
  The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing
  ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurect an evil goddess,
  Gozer.
  .
  Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view.
  From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for
  "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area.
  The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic.
  Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en
  route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the
  ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap
  to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed
  trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it.
  Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to
  purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle.
  Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.
  .
  As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must
  keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures.
  Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still
  manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.

  Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The

  ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to
  trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them,
  wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in
  bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and
  water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms.
  Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will
  float around the screen trying to destroy the player.

  shoots toothbrushes, Stimpy spits), but each one has his own special ability:
  Ren can perform high jumps, Stimpy can smash things jumping over them. Each
  character starts the game with three lives.
  .
  Throughout levels such as "The Blacker Than Black Forest", "The Stinking Dry
  Desert" or "The Stinking Wet Bayou", Ren and Stimpy will face most animal
  enemies, such as birds, frogs, vultures, woodpeckers, snakes, etc. The levels

  To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must
  venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical
  forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow
  in order to confront and defeat the witch.
  .
  Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can
  be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects
  lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and
  throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them
  around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right
  spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In
  some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object
  is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets
  access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or

description:
  Sega decided to make their last game in the Fantasy Zone series different. You
  see, the gameplay now involves you going around mazes, collecting all the dots
  while avoiding enemies. You are awarded points for each dot collected, but they
  vary depending on their size. For example, small dots award ten points each,
  while you get 200 points for each larger dot you collect. Once you have
  collected all the dots in the maze, the enemies will turn into coins, which you
  must quickly get in a strict time limit and you move on to the next maze. Just
  before this, though, you get a statistics screen that shows the amount of time
  that you spent in the maze. Points are also awarded, but sadly, if you spent
  over sixty seconds in a maze, you won't get any.
  .
  Every world you travel to consist of three mazes, and after you complete all
  three, a bonus round appears where the object is to collect all coins before
  time expires. While you are collecting the dots in the normal mazes, you must
  touch the enemy's energy, a flashing red spot within each maze to avoid
  2nd-generation enemies from entering the mazes. Some power-ups can be collected,
  which consist of weapons and speed boosters (big wings), which can be collected
  by landing on the circle which it is in. However, you need money in form of the
  amount outlined just before each maze. If you land on a circle while you are
  short of cash, a 'NO SELLING' sign will appear above it, and you have to collect
  some more dots and try again.
  .
  Also you can die by touching an enemy. When you die, a coin will take you place,
  and when you get resurrected, you can grab the coin. The game can be played with
  two players, but the same rule applies in a 2-player game.

  your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a
  time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.
  .
  The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4
  points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car
  off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which
  involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level,
  although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared
  the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks
  are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system
  as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

  Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young
  police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city
  controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant,
  which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the
  syndicate by themselves.
  .
  Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump,
  other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car.
  Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or
  performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if
  holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing
  with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is
  slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but
  a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.\n
  Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right
  (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast
  as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels
  feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing
  enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several
  items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and
  lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).

  The game features 12 levels split into three distinct styles. First of all
  you'll be flying over a city in your helicopter, shooting out tanks by ducking
  low enough to target them, but also climbing to avoid the skyscrapers in the
  area. The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out
  the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.
  .
  The second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds
  helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down
  to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.

  door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you
  shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered
  unfair, and you won't score any points, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you
  and you lose one of your three lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will
  come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the
  dynamite to get rid of it.

  If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If
  you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than
  not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying "I haven't got anything".
  That's when they will be replaced by bandits.

  Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and
  shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will

  difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will
  block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what
  round you're on, you can shoot so many bandits before time runs out.

  and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait
  Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own
  choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties
  that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To
  defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More
  often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of
  fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get
  other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters
  will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots,
  bombs, and fireballs.
  .
  In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and
  the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that
  gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes
  underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface
  again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to
  squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

description:
  Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is a direct sequel to Wonder Boy in Monster
  Land. When Tom-Tom defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on
  him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To regain your original human form, you have
  to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster Land.
  .
  In this side-scrolling platform game, you can still buy equipment and items, but
  unlike its predecessor, it is not divided in sequences of levels. You are
  allowed to go anywhere, as long as you have the right shape or equipment. During
  his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will give you a
  new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or
  clinging to walls, which also give you to access new parts of the world. The
  possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man
  and the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and charm
  points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks
  can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain
  shapes.
  .
  The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen you
  can equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls,
  tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, you collect
  keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated creatures, and you
  often have to revisit places to access new areas. A password is given at the
  beginning of each town to continue from there.

  The game resembles Alex Kidd in Miracle World quite a bit. Kkachi has to
  retrieve six keys from six stages that are selectable from the beginning.
  Enemies are either beaten by slapping them or by using limited special moves.
  There are random items (garlic, fruit, etc.) lying or floating around throughout
  the levels that amount to money, which can be used in stores to buy items. After
  each (mostly uninspired) bossfight, Kkachi gets also a special weapon only
  usable against bosses. Unfortunately the mechanic is broken and only the first
  weapon ever gained can be used, and even that only once throughout the entire

game: Road Rash
file: Road Rash (Europe, Brazil).zip
developer: U.S. Gold
publisher: U.S. Gold
description:
  Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the
  role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A.
  Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a
  linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very
  well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs,
  crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion
  and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with
  normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil
  slicks and stray cows.
  .
  By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with
  which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit
  something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus
  your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it
  is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.
  .
  Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no
  intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode,
  this is not simultaneous.

game: Alien Storm
file: Alien Storm (Europe, Brazil).zip
developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them
  out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and
  Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.
  .
  When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as.
  There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several
  stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from
  the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens.
  Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get
  tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants,
  postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective
  such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.
  .
  When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot
  to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours
  get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you
  can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see.
  These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of
  the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs
  across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present
  location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will
  then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of
  energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.
  .
  At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to
  complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings
  where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens
  popping up from several locations with the building.
  .
  You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.

  The merciless Sapo Boi, with the help of the evil Lagartão and Sibila, the
  sorceress snake, recruited an army of monsters to take over the swamp and
  enslave its inhabitants. He also kidnapped Rãzinha, Sapo Xulé's girlfriend, to
  make her his princess. Now, Sapo Xulé, along with his three friends (Ratopulga,
  Porcopum and Tartafede) must to stop the cruel tyrant.
  .
  Sapo Xulé vs. Os Invasores do Brejo (which translates Sapo Xulé vs. The Swamp
  Invaders) is a modified version of Psycho Fox, with its main character replaced
  by Sapo Xulé, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the '80s; a
  toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.
  .
  In Psycho Fox, the player could also play as three other characters during the
  game: Hippo, Monkey Boy and Leopard. In Sapo Xulé vs. Os Invasores do Brejo,
  they were replaced by Porcopum (a pig), Ratopulga (a mouse) and Tartafede (a
  turtle).
  .
  Each character has its own special ability: Porcopum can break rock walls (but
  he's considerably slower than the others). Ratopulga can jump higher than any
  other character, while Tartafede is the fastest one. Sapo Xulé is the most
  balanced of them.
  .
  In this side-scrolling/platform game, all characters can kill their enemies by
  punching or jumping on top of them, until they are completely buried. If they
  are not buried completely, the enemies will pop out of the ground and come after
  the character again. Besides the monsters, other common obstacles are spikes,
  cannonballs, fireballs, pits and more.
  .
  The characters can also find Sapo Xulé's stinky shoes, which can be used as a
  boomerang-like weapon. If they are hit when carrying the shoe, they'll just lose
  it instead of dying.
  .
  To switch among the characters, the player must find green potions, usually
  hidden inside eggs, or carried by enemies. Other special items can be collected,
  such as "invincibility flies", Sapo Xulé's stinky socks (which kill every enemy
  on the screen) and some white bags, which are meant to be used at the bonus
  stages.
  .
  The bonus stages consist of labyrinths with several paths, each leading to
  prizes or nothing at all. Each white bag collected at the main stages give the
  player an extra character to set up for a different path at the labyrinth,
  raising the chances of reaching a prize in the end.
  .
  Apart from changes in the main characters, some enemy sprites were replaced,
  such as the first boss - which came to be Sibila, the sorceress snake - and
  obviously the last one - which came to be Sapo Boi.

description:
  Psycho Fox is a platform game where you play a fox and you must get through
  seven worlds, consisting of three areas each. At the end of each world, there
  are one of seven bosses waiting to destroy you, but some of the later bosses are
  exactly the same as the earlier ones. The title is a bit misleading because you
  can also play as three other characters including Hippo, Leopard, and Monkey
  Boy. Each character has their own disadvantages. For example, Hippo is much
  slower than the other three. However, all the characters share one thing in
  common: they can use their fists and punch enemies as they approach them. They
  can also jump on them and keep knocking them in the ground until they disappear
  off the face of the earth. If they don't make them disappear, they will pop back
  out again and set out for revenge. Obstacles are scattered through each area,
  including spikes, cannonballs, esculators, fireballs, and steam.
  .
  You start the game with three lives. Once you touch an enemy, you lose a life.
  Lose any of your lives, and the game is over. If the game is over, you can
  continue where you left off. There are several items to find, and these can help
  you on your quest, and one of these items are eggs. If you break any of these
  eggs, either the "switch" item or the invincibility item is revealed. If you're
  lucky enough, a white bag is also revealed, but more often than not, one of your
  enemies can pop out from inside the egg. One egg will reveal a bird which you
  can carry for the rest of the game. This bird may be nothing but a pest, as it
  hinders your progress, but you can throw it at enemies to knock them out. It can
  also be used as a backup, meaning that you can have enemies touching you, but it
  is the bird that is killed, not you.
  .
  There is little chance that you'll find a white bag inside an egg, unless you go
  up into a secret area, which can often be found if you jump on springs that are
  scattered throughout the level. These white bags are useless, until you get to
  the bonus areas, which are at the end of each area. In these bonus stages, you
  can place a number of foxes on a path depending on how much white bags you've
  collected throughout each area.
  .
  When you complete Psycho Fox, you are treated to a funny ending.

  Unfortunately, Gilba was successfully resurrected and another warrior, Danan,
  was called. His quest is to locate the three sacred objects that Aganan used to
  defeat Gilbas: "The Orb of Light", "The Amulet of Light", and "The Knife of
  Light".
  .
  There are about four rounds to complete, and has Danan going through exotic
  locations defeating enemies such as valkyries, ogres, bees, spiders, and several
  others. At the end of each round, you come face to face with a boss, which takes
  quite a number of hits to kill with your sword. Once they are defeated, they are
  likely to give you one of the objects that you need to defeat Gilbas. More to
  the story is then revealed.
  .
  Assisting you with your journey are three animals: an eagle, a monkey, and some
  other animal that I am unfamiliar with. To get these animals to help you,
  however, you will need to collect three of their tokens that are found in yellow
  chests. These animals are quite useful in dangerous situations. The eagle, for
  example, can get a hold of you and fly you to safety if more than one type of
  enemy surrounds you. Anyway, you can get these animals to help you at any place,
  at any time, as long as you have three of its tokens. Yellow chests can also
  reveal extra strength, extra time, or extra health.
  .
  The game ends when you run out of time, or when you lose your health, and there
  are no second chances, unless you manage to find some elixirs, which are rare.

  SEGA's mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut in a famous Genesis title, but
  Sega's 8-bit systems got their own version of the platformer featuring the same
  story and gameplay style but different levels. To stop the evil Dr. Robotnik,
  Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of the zones
  are based on the original game, but some are new. Enemies and power-ups are
  mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when
  hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings
  gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow
  access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final
  level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Sonic should also
  collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands.
  In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special
  stages but somewhere in the regular levels.

  Joe Montana (Joe Cool) was an American National Football League player playing
  for the San Francisco 49ers as a quarterback. He was voted by the Associated
  Press as the most valuable player two years running (1989-90).
  .
  In Joe Montana Football the player can play a game of American Football with Joe
  Montana giving the player basic tips on the next best move. The player can play
  against a friend or play the computer with 3 difficulty levels (beginner,
  normal, and professional) in a full game (5 min per quarter) using all the real
  rules and scoring. The teams are made up of 28 American city names with no team
  names (or player names) mentioned. Once the coin is flipped and the kick-off the
  game begins.
  .
  The player controls the on-screen player as they try to run up the field. Once
  the player is downed the game turns to a play selection screen where the player
  can choose their next play (tactic) out of the 17 different preset plays
  available, as well as a punt, attempt at a field goal, or a turnover, all done
  in full view of the opponent (the CPU will change their play to match yours).
  More often then not Joe himself will give a tip on the best play that it will
  default to. On the field the player controlling the quarterback can throw it to
  the receiver (changing the player control to the receiver), change the receiver
  to pass to, or try to run with the quarterback. When play changes hands and the
  player becomes a defender the player has 6 defensive plays to choose from as
  well as a turnover. On the field the player controls a single player chosen by
  cycling though the players or selecting the player closest to the selected
  receiver. Two player mode works the same as single player but with a player
  instead of the computer.

  The game screen is divided into three sections. This includes a first-person
  view of the map, in which you can see objects that are coming your way. There

  In each of these seven areas, there are several floors which can be reached via
  the elevator. At the beginning of the game, your only weapons are your fists,
  but weapons can be collected throughout each area, which include psycho punch,
  ray gun, light gun, and bombs. Power-ups like extra life and psycho power can
  also be collected. If you use the psycho punch or psycho gun, your psycho power
  gets depleted, and when it is empty, you must stock up on some more. You can
  also get shields that will protect you from laser beams, and jet engines so that
  you can fly over hazards.\n
  In some areas, you defeat a boss which leaves an ID card, which you can use to
  access other areas of the fortress.
  .
  Some chief cyborgs are easy to kill, while some are hard. You will just have to
  work out which weapon works best with them. The game ends when you lose all your
  life.

  You are not alone in this mission. You also have Adina, your contact back at

  lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting

  spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

  3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream
  pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the
  targets shoot back.

description:
  Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks
  in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3
  same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3
  or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5
  count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The
  real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so
  as to create other lines.
  .
  As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim
  is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of
  bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of
  complete rows which are already in place.

  Virtua Fighter Animation is an one-on-one 2D fighting game based on the Virtua
  Fighter anime series. It has two game modes: story and versus.
  .
  In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style
  cutscenes before and after each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of
  them corresponding to one fight. The player starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as
  he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be chosen
  in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available
  are Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau
  Chan. In the final act, the player must fight against Dural.
  .
  The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters
  to fight against the CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed
  from the character selection.
  .
  The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and
  Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode shows the fighters from a more distant
  position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The Real-Time
  mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games,
  alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro
  sequence, with anime style cutscenes.
  .
  In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting
  game, as the player can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps
  (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game Gear version has also a block
  function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are
  regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this
  three possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring
  or they have less energy than the opponent if the time runs out.

  THE FATE OF THE HAN DYNASTY IS IN YOUR HANDS!
  .
  In the final years of the Eastern Han Dynasty, under the reign of Emperor Ling,
  ten eunuchs in the imperial palace abused their power. The country was in a
  dreadful state of affairs; bandits began an uprising, and the people were in
  turmoil.
  .
  The emperor asked the lords of the land to crush the rebellion, but this only
  resulted in a race for power. After Dong Zhuo usurped the throne only to be
  quickly defeated, civil war erupted.
  .
  Finally, it was Cao Cao who took control of the emperor, commanding the lords in
  his name. After years of harsh fighting, Cao Cao united the north and prepared
  to conquer the south in an attempt to unite all of China.
  .
  Liu Bei, the fate of the Han Dynasty is in your hands! Will you linger in fear,
  waiting for death to find you? Or will you take a stand against the evil forces
  of Cao Cao? Don't hesitate; take your five tiger generals and rush to destroy
  the enemy!

developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Sega's 8-bit systems received their own version of the Genesis' popular Disney
  platformer. Story and themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and
  slightly different gameplay mechanics.
  .
  To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must
  venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical
  forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow
  in order to confront and defeat the witch.
  .
  Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can
  be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects
  lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and
  throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them
  around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right
  spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In
  some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object
  is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets
  access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or
  coins to collect for points.

  Made in the hey-day of SEGA's sprite scaling hardware (After Burner, Out Run) in
  the arcades, Galaxy Force is a combination of After Burner and G-Loc R-360 set
  in space.
  .
  The game is divided into four "scenes", or planets: the A world is a green
  planet, world B is a fire-ridden lava planet, world C is a green water planet
  and world D is barren ice planet. You must fly your spaceship above the planet's
  surface, facing not only Space Harrier-style enemy attack waves, but also
  natural phenomena such as meteorites, lava eruptions and tornadoes. To fight
  them, you have a vulcan as well as an undepletable stock of missiles.
  .
  Once you have fought your way across the planet, you enter a tunnel system in
  the inner confines of the planet. As the tunnel turns, you are given directions
  as to which way you must manoeuvre, but the narrow tunnel gives you little space
  to take evasive action. Once you escape the tunnel, the entire planet is
  destroyed, leading you towards the ultimate boss encounter.

  Coming back from the vacation Sonic took after foiling the plans of Dr Robotnik,
  he finds that Tails and all his other animal friends are missing. Sonic finds a
  letter waiting for him, that reads:
  .
  "Dear Sonic,
  .
  Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding
  me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and
  bring the six Chaos Emeralds.
  .
  Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six
  really nasty robots in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know
  what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful!
  .
  Sincerely, Tails."
  .
  That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat
  Robotnik again.
  .
  The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis.
  Tails obviously doesn't accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic
  can also not do his infamous buzzsaw roll by simply ducking and pressing jump.

description:
  You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To
  win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the
  vermin who worship that other god.
  .
  Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the
  wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To
  get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to
  build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be,
  so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing
  the same.
  .
  When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a
  hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength
  from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he
  gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will
  burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.
  .
  But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other
  tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering
  powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their
  best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who
  didn't build on high-ground.
  .
  And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just
  never done.

developer: SEGA

description:
  Every system must have a Breakout clone, and every self-respecting developer
  must have one, especially in the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito's
  Arkanoid. Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.
  .
  With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your
  ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come
  out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks", wind-up toy soldiers or
  robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross
  your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big
  black hole as in most other games of this kind – instead the whole covers only a
  part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the
  corners.
  .
  Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms
  to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.
  .
  Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special
  blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat
  or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its path without
  ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire,
  allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits
  bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would
  otherwise have required several.

game: Ultima IV : Quest of the Avatar
file: Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar (Europe, Brazil).zip
developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved
  game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now
  have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is
  its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the
  story and goal.
  .
  Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the
  Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become
  the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant
  upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In
  most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would
  usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV
  you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it
  was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was
  typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up
  everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game
  keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like
  in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.
  .
  This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV
  famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made
  all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre.
  .
  Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as
  dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final
  "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to
  complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

  Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa is the sequel to Fantasy Zone, in which
  you control Opa-Opa, a pretty colored ship with wings on its side. You must
  destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your
  task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you
  destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up
  and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way
  shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of
  enemies all in a row.
  .
  More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a
  dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the
  land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate
  in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you
  must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the
  original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend
  money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).

  GP Rider is an arcade like motorcycle racing game that players can race in all
  the tracks of all the 15 tracks of the 1989 Motorcycle Grand Prix. There is also
  an extra Arcade track for the player to race on.
  .
  There are 3 modes of play that are Arcade, Tournament, and Grand Prix. In Arcade
  the player races on only 1 track that is named Arcade. In Tournament players get
  to choose any number of tracks to race, from 0 (which defaults to the Arcade
  track) to all 15 available tracks. Grand Prix is where the player races in all
  15 tracks in order of the 1989 season.
  .
  All races regardless of the mode played in the same way. The game is played on a
  split screen even if only one player is playing. A CPU character named Wayne
  controls the bike on the top screen if there is no other player playing. Wayne
  races like a real player would, having both good and bad races and occasionally
  making mistakes. The race is made up of a Qualify to determine gird position and
  then the Race where the player races 15 other races (including Wayne) over a
  predefined number of laps depending on track length. The track can raced in
  ether the wet or the dry (only dry in Arcade mode) and the weather can change
  from the Qualify to the Race. The races take place on flat roads with straights
  and curves simulating the layout of the real track. On the bike there is a fuel
  gage that simply counts down the seconds left of fuel and is automatically
  refilled at the completion of each lap. If the player doesn’t complete the lap
  before time runs out then the player will “Out of Fuel” and end the race in the
  placed down with other non-finishers. At the end of each race (accept in Arcade
  mode) the player will get points depending on there position before going onto
  the next race.
  .
  The player sets up the bike with some basic set ups that are all available from
  the start. In Arcade mode the player has the options of an Automatic or Manual
  gearbox with either High Gearing (better top speed) or Low Gearing (better
  acceleration). In Tournament and Grand Prix modes the options are extended to
  Engine type of Lean, Medium, and Thirsty which progressively adds speed while
  cutting the time available per lap. There is gearing that works the same as
  Arcade mode, and a tyre type of wet and dry depending on the weather.

  ‘up’ referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on player preference. You are

  hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black.

  Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the
  amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt
  easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes,

  fight just like in the "Rocky" movies you have to train. Practice your timing
  and punching strength with some sandbag punching before fighting Apollo.  Warm
  up punching a punching ball to become more faster and smarter to get ready for
  Lang. Then you will do some punching mitts training before fighting Drago where
  you watch the mitts and punch at the as they move. All of these trainings have
  qualifications such as punches per second, qualify and your combinations get
  better for the following fight.
  .
  During a fight you only have one meter under your name, that is the power meter.
  Your opponent has one likewise. Watching your power bar can tell you a lot about
  which way the fight is headed, either it's full and you can take more punches
  and punch more powerfully or it's low and you're in  trouble. Watching the
  opponents power bar will tell you when to take him down or when to block.
  .
  Between rounds you get a chance to freshen up and get some last minute coaching.
  During the one minute interval, your power will go up only half of what has been
  drained.
  .
  If you do happen to take a fall the controls are similar to Nintendos "Punch

  friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

description:
  This version of Great Soccer is on the SEGA card. The other version of Great
  Soccer is on the SEGA cartridge and an entirely different game.
  .
  This top-down perspective soccer game is just like a regular soccer match.
  Offsides, corner kicks and many other rulings make the game authentic. Whether
  on offense or defense, the player must gain control of the ball and score as
  often as possible. The team that ends up with the most goals at the end of
  regulation time wins.

game: Ninja Gaiden
file: Ninja Gaiden (Europe, Brazil).zip
developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  The Master System version of Ninja Gaiden is not a port of the well-known NES
  game, but an entirely new game (this includes both a different story and
  different levels) developed by SIMS under license from Tecmo.
  .
  The story is also about the original protagonist, the Dragon ninja Ryu Hayabusa,
  who returns to his clan's village only to find it utterly destroyed and the
  inhabitants murdered. A single survivor tells Ryu in his last seconds that the
  Sacred Scroll of Bushido was stolen. With the power of the scroll its owner is
  mighty enough the gain control of the whole world. Thus Ryu swears to recapture
  the scroll and the avenge the annihilation of his clan.
  .
  The game is sidescrolling platformer/ beat'em up title and incorporates most of
  the mechanics from the NES games: Ryu can jump and attack with his Dragon Sword.
  Furthermore, he can collect different kinds of Ninja Magic (which again vary
  form the powers in the NES games), from shuriken to fire wheels, which can only
  be used finitely many times, as the use up energy which again must be collected.
  However, instead of clinging to walls and climbing them, Ryu can push himself
  off the wall in this game, which must be applied for instance by jumping and
  forth between two close walls to get higher and higher.
  .
  The goal of each level is simply to reach the end of the level before the time
  runs out. Each level is divided into several sections, and at the end of each
  level is a boss fight. After beating a boss, a cut scene is shown which
  continues the story about Ryu's quest for the Bushido scroll and his revenge.

game: Andre Agassi Tennis

developer: Tecmagik
publisher: Tecmagik
description:
  A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early
  90s with his "Image is everything" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and
  colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes eight players (male and female and
  as as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to movement speed
  and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand.
  .
  Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all
  kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise
  positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court,
  swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on
  the head.\n
  Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth,
  Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according
  to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a "Skins" game, where each
  point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.

game: Kujaku Ou
file: SpellCaster (USA, Europe, Brazil).zip
developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Kujakuo is based on the comic by the same name, published in Young Jump in the
  late eighties and drawn by Makoto Ogino. It is a tale of the occult, centred
  around the buddhist monk Kujaku.
  .
  In this game, Kujaku is sent out by his master, Ajari, to find out what has
  happened at the nearby temple of Hieizan. Upon arriving, after having fought his
  way through magical creatures and deadly warriors, he find his comrades slain.
  One of them, Kubira, is still holding on to his life, and before drawing his
  last breath, he utters the word "Izumo". Ajuri then sends Kujaku to the town of
  Izumo, where he encounters a deadly enemy of unknown origin.
  .
  Kujakuo is part adventure game à la Déjà vu (or, since this is a Sega game,
  Hoshi o sagashite), part platform action. To get between the adventure parts,
  you must pass an action level, as well as a boss fight or two, just as in Cosmic
  Spacehead.
  .
  The adventure part has you looking at a scenery, with a text box for
  descriptions and lines, and a set of verbs on the right. Use a cursor to point
  out specific objects for your verbs.
  .
  In the platform levels, Kujaku can jump and shoot magic bolts. While the usual
  bolt is small, he can load up before releasing them, R-Type style. Pressing the
  pause button opens up the spell menu, for accessing more powerful magical
  spells. New spells can be learned throughout the game. Most spells are
  offensive, but some grant additional powers such as levitation. Each time a
  spell is activated, you use up your limited spirit energy. Enemies will, when
  killed, sometimes drop spheres that will raise your spirit energy, though.
  .
  This game was remade into Spellcaster upon its release in the West.

developer: Image Works
publisher: Image Works
description:
  Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to
  pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level
  boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and
  every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this
  cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed & health
  upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.
  .
  The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of
  the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with
  dead-ends in the game, your spaceship  scrolls backwards when you keep pressing
  the down key.
  .
  A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by
  British electronica group Bomb The Bass.

  This edition of the classic driving game takes the original and adds a 3D view,
  using the Master System's 3D glasses. Little else is modified. You still drive a
  red Ferrari on a road which forks into more and more levels. The main
  differences are the levels, which look slightly different, the fact that your
  Ferrari is slightly smaller than the original Master System conversion, and that
  there are three new sound tracks to choose from; Midnight Highway, Color Ocean
  and Shining Wind. The original Magical Sound Shower is still left for the
  traditionalists.

  Sukeban Deka II: Shoujo Tekkamen Densetsu ("Delinquent Girl Cop: Legend of the
  Maiden's Iron Mask") is a game based on the Sukeban Deka license, specifically
  that of the TV show remake in the 80s which was named Sukeban Deka II (which is
  why this game has no predecessor despite being a "II"). The series follows a
  Japanese schoolgirl who has chosen to fight crime after flaunting the law
  herself one too many times. Her only notable characteristic, as far as this game
  is concerned, is the use of a weaponized metal yo-yo to pummel her foes.

description:
  Unreleased Game : NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, was one of the
  first real playable basketball arcade games, and was also one of the first
  sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized
  likenesses. A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play -
  players jumped many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied
  both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free
  throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant
  the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way.
  Additionally, the game had an "on fire" feature, where if one player made three
  baskets in a row, he would become "on fire" and have unlimited turbo, no
  goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the
  player had scored four consecutive baskets while "on fire").
