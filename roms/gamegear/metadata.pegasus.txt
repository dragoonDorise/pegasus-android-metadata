    summons the awful monster Minotaur. Arle has no choice but to run away, and she
    falls down through a trap into a dungeon. It appears she is now alone there,

  game: Head Buster
  file: Head Buster (Japan).zip
  developer: Masaya Games
  publisher: Masaya Games
  description:
    Head Buster is a so-called ”future sports” game about robots. On a top-down,
    horizontally scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner
    similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, albeit without many of the
    refinements of that series.
    .
    Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped
    according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot
    arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly
    to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order
    to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount
    of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat
    phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over,
    you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.
    .
    Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be
    modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different
    movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both
    different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets.
    Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays
    out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be
    added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging,
    shielding and healing.

    Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some
    pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure
    and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and
    talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select
    actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts
    used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the
    action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade
    dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once
    you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you
    decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password
    allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.

    Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging
    mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky,

    Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600,

    levels are inspired by classic movies, but given a Garfield twist, like
    "Catsablanca" and "The Curse of Cleofartra.

  description:
    Coming back from the vacation Sonic took after foiling the plans of Dr Robotnik,
    he finds that Tails and all his other animal friends are missing. Sonic finds a
    letter waiting for him, that reads:
    .
    "Dear Sonic,
    .
    Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding
    me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and
    bring the six Chaos Emeralds.
    .
    Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six
    really nasty robots in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know
    what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful!
    .
    Sincerely, Tails."
    .
    That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat
    Robotnik again.
    .
    The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis.
    Tails obviously doesn't accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic
    can also not do his infamous buzzsaw roll by simply ducking and pressing jump.

    unlocking the characters equals rescuing him. On the way, there several foes
    from the X-Men universe to beat, and at the end, Magneto once again needs a
    reprehension.

    The basic mechanics of the game are punching, (double-)jumping and jump-kicking.
    Furthermore, pressing Start activates/ deactivates the characters mutant
    ability, for example Wolverine's claws or Cyclops' laser beams. Using it however
    drains a limited amount of energy, which can be refreshed by finding

    Fighter anime series. It has two game modes: story and versus.
    .
    In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style
    cutscenes before and after each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of
    them corresponding to one fight. The player starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as
    he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be chosen
    in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available
    are Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau
    Chan. In the final act, the player must fight against Dural.
    .
    The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters
    to fight against the CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed
    from the character selection.
    .
    The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and
    Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode shows the fighters from a more distant
    position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The Real-Time
    mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games,
    alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro
    sequence, with anime style cutscenes.
    .
    In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting
    game, as the player can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps
    (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game Gear version has also a block
    function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are
    regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this
    three possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring
    or they have less energy than the opponent if the time runs out.

    .
    In this platform game the player is prompted to choose playing either as Ren or
    Stimpy at the start of new life or some stages. Both can jump and shoot (Ren
    shoots toothbrushes, Stimpy spits), but each one has his own special ability:
    Ren can perform high jumps, Stimpy can smash things jumping over them. Each
    character starts the game with three lives.
    .
    Throughout levels such as "The Blacker Than Black Forest", "The Stinking Dry
    Desert" or "The Stinking Wet Bayou", Ren and Stimpy will face most animal
    enemies, such as birds, frogs, vultures, woodpeckers, snakes, etc. The levels
    are divided in few or several sub-level, and at the end of each level, they'll
    face a boss.
    .
    They'll also find some unusual weapons, as a slice of bread (which flies in
    circles), a remote controller (which casts electric waves) and a soap bar (which
    casts bubbles). If they get hit when using a weapon, they'll lose it, but won't
    lose health. They'll gain health by picking items like TVs, cash bags, bottles
    and boots.

    Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks
    in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3
    same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3
    or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5
    count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The
    real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so
    as to create other lines.
    .
    As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim
    is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of
    bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of
    complete rows which are already in place.

    from many available). The game consists mainly of large strategic turn-based
    battles, in which you navigate your characters around and attack the enemies
    physically, or cast area-based spells.

  game: Kinetic Connection
  file: Kinetic Connection (Japan).zip
  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    The Game Gear version of Kinetic Connection has been rearranged a lot from the
    original version released 5 years earlier to cope with a smaller screen and
    Sega's taste in motifs.
    .
    As the original version, Kinetic Connection is a jigsaw puzzle game, where the
    pieces are animated. This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall
    picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not
    analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about.
    Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit
    together.
    .
    The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions
    but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the
    pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original
    Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order.
    Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:
    .
    Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece
    and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the
    player slide entire rows and columns around in the puzzle. The two second modes
    call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.

  description:
    Long ago, the evil Cablon ravaged the Copto planet, a light year away of the
    Algol system. When he was defeated, he was sealed on a planet discovered by
    Alis, the heroine of the first "Phantasy Star", a planet that was also known as
    Alisland. In this gaiden (side-story) set in Phantasy Star universe, you play
    the role of two young people from the village Tedo - Alec and Mina. One day,
    Mina finds an old artifact. While wondering what that could be, the young people
    learn that Alec' father was attacked and kidnapped by bandits. Determined to
    find him, the two heroes embark on a dangerous journey that will eventually lead
    them much further than they suspect.
    .
    Phantasy Star Gaiden plays pretty much like any other Phantasy Star starting
    with the second game: both towns and dungeons are in top-down view, the
    turn-based battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay is
    standard console-style RPG: you should fight random enemies, gain experience and
    gold, buy better equipment, visit many towns and dungeons, etc.

  description:
    One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for
    Sega's 8-bit systems combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming
    levels.
    .
    In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be
    recaptured. Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs
    attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the
    player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful
    dinosaur follows.
    .
    After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform
    section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors
    that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam
    leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the
    way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher
    and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the
    dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.
    .
    The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and
    Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the
    Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.

    "Dear Sonic,
    .
    Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding
    me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and
    bring the six Chaos Emeralds.
    .
    Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six
    really nasty robots in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know
    what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful!
    .
    Sincerely, Tails."
    .
    That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat
    Robotnik again.
    .
    The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis.
    Tails obviously doesn't accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic

    The Adventures of Batman & Robin is 2D platformer/ beat'em up. The goal in each
    stage and level is to walk from left to right to reach the (sub)boss and the end
    of the stage. To beat his foes, Batman uses punches and kicks in close combat
    and several weapons for short distances. Batman has an unlimited supply of
    Batarangs with him from the beginning, and there are four more weapons

    to fulfill a set goal on a screen already filled with a certain arrangement of
    Puyos.
    .
    These goals may be to simply eliminate all Puyos on-screen, to eliminate all
    Puyos of a certain colour, or to eliminate a certain number of Puyos at once.
    You may also be asked to do a "rensa", or chain reaction, in a certain number of
    steps. A "rensa" is arranged by making so that if one set of four or more Puyos
    is eliminated, it will make neighbouring Puyos fall so that new combinations
    arise, and are eliminated. The fulfillment of the goals may be complicated by
    the fact that you are given only Puyos of a certain colour to work with.

    "Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense

    hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for
    yearly revisions of the concept.
    .
    There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of
    other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the
    time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents
    and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and
    systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.

    The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game
    even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system

    FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown
    players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and
    Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to
    match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can

    exactly what it is. It's even more interesting that you realize that there is a
    touch of bingo in there too. Your objective is to draw face-down cards from one
    of four different piles and draw these cards into five different "hands" that
    are scored as traditional poker values. Hower the the hands may be scored in any
    combinasion... vertical, horizonal or diagonal on the game board... (where the
    bingo element comes into play).

  description:
    Riddick Bowe Boxing is another one of the many boxing games released at the
    time, but with subtle differences. The HUD contains damage and energy meters
    along with a miniature ring up the top of the screen, useful to see the player's
    position in the ring so as not to get backed into a corner real easily.
    .
    Players can compete in the standard, 1-Player v. CPU, 1-Player v. 2-Player or
    even a career mode, where there are four preset fighters to choose from along
    with an option to create customers boxers. The career starts out at position #25
    in the ranking and players slowly work up the ladder, going to the gym in
    between bouts to build up stats to eventually take on "Big Daddy" himself,
    Riddick Bowe.
    .
    The game is practically a copy of Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, save for
    the graphics style and the included fighters.

  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working
    late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot,
    thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from
    his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up
    to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating
    plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle -
    workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and
    rescue his dad!
    .
    The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the
    player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the
    basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle,
    whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon
    is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at
    them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down
    the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread
    throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special
    skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby
    Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy
    Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.
    .
    Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and
    raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several
    entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the
    Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point
    reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing
    your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies.
    The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely
    missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.

    the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the
    human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men
    must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the

  description:
    Your name is Kevin Codner – rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the
    distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your
    little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need
    your keen oversight and "shipsmarts".
    .
    In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers)
    as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level.
    Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the
    level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and
    bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a
    crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the
    wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to
    their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually
    choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.
    .
    There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with
    throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult,
    involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam
    from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack
    crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other
    to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually
    done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.
    .
    Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a
    certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and
    lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the
    compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers
    will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of
    time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some
    assistance.
    .
    At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that
    you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress
    through them all from the get-go.

  description:
    Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the
    role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space
    Mutants from invading Springfield.
    .
    On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients
    that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as
    purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens
    existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family
    members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and
    Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human
    bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart
    must use his X-ray Specs.
    .
    The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are
    numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects.
    He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little
    puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.
    .
    Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like
    buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to
    solve some puzzles in the game.

    .
    Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either
    Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's
    universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.
    .
    Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for
    instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The
    task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures
    matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.
    .
    After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with
    the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will
    receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters
    would like to receive that hammer.
    .
    Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie
    access to the last puzzle and character.

    Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate

    in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage.
    Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the
    machine guns, and are shot to be collected.
    .
    T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general
    concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns
    down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a
    besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy
    supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time
    to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet
    research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend
    off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

    Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold
    Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final

  description:
    Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the
    role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A.
    Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a
    linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very
    well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs,
    crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion
    and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with
    normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil
    slicks and stray cows.
    .
    By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with
    which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit
    something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus
    your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it
    is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.
    .
    Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no
    intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode,
    this is not simultaneous.

    This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the
    NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and
    deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories,
    from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.
    .
    Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player
    for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face
    each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player
    with a CPU team-mate.
    .
    The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for
    substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which
    lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover.
    Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes
    four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:
    .
    1. "Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to
    a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.
    .
    Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when
    picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy,
    monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other
    players to the ground.
    .
    "Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.
    .
    "Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and
    challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra
    players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher
    CPU difficulty level.

    market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.
    .
    Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in
    each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how
    good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides
    can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer
    operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges
    quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set
    pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and
    then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be
    selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these

  description:
    Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of
    classics such as Rogue or Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws
    you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and
    most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal
    their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in
    each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There
    are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and
    food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from
    starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced
    turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with
    the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually
    grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.

    .
    Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most

    Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be
    found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration,
    timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a
    shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas
    and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the "Daytime" and the
    "Nighttime". These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and
    1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor
    enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded

  description:
    Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed)
    international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and
    strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament,
    playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one
    of them must be completed in one sitting.
    .
    The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key
    aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight
    (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be
    deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are
    slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and
    momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also
    included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a
    lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes
    from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.
    .
    Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D
    effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted
    down to show more of the field.

    Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are
    changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more
    animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move
    was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several
    new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all
    enemies and the radically different new characters.

    Genki's first game is a paddle/pong game with a background story. Once upon a

    jealous demon named "Y" turn them both into stone paddles. Suddenly, a blue
    sphere fell from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles can now push
    forwards, overcoming obstacles and defeating demons.
    .
    "Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two
    paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent
    the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to
    hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You
    advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the
    level boss enemy appears.

    Tails' Skypatrol is the first solo adventure of the Sonic sidekick Tails in the
    Sonic the Hedgehog series and it was only released in Japan.
    .
    While flying around, Tails discovers an island. It seems to be completely
    abandoned except for some mine cart tracks. As he lands on the island a cart
    approaches, and Tails hides in the bushes. The passing silver cart is driven by
    a woman who says she is Wendy Witchcart. She proclaims that everything on the
    island is hers and threatens to transform everyone in crystal who does not
    follow her rules. Tails, determined to save all the animals on the island, sets
    in a chase to the Witchcart.
    .
    Gameplay is fairly similar to the Sonic series. Tails need to defeat enemies and
    complete obstacles. He can fly, but is constantly suspended. He carries a golden
    rind that is used to take out enemies or to latch on to devices. Sonic, the
    emeralds and Dr. Robotnik are not presented, and neither are there rings to
    collect during the levels.
    .

    Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story: Captains
    Kirk and Picard must team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an
    inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious Nexus energy ribbon.
    .
    The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen
    from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you
    navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies
    like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship
    to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.
    .
    On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control
    a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.
    .
    Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be
    decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only
    guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the
    selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right
    place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a
    limited number of tries.
    .
    The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To
    do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path
    must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together,
    similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

    changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster'
    Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same
    name, which is entirely different.
    .
    Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a
    series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship
    title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and
    show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to
    avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that
    can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when
    no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's
    points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to
    be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow
    or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.
    .
    Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be
    charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the
    back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the
    ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won
    match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three
    characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.

    Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting

    the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten
    tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be
    conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament

    undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament

    special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their
    second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality"
    on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically
    kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

    Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its

  developer: Systemsoft
  publisher: Systemsoft
  description:
    The Game Gear version of the grand old lady of war simulations, Daisenryaku,
    arranges a war between the fictive Red and Blue countries. On one of thirty
    different maps, units are produced and moved out into combat, and the war is
    only over when the enemy capital has been conquered.
    .
    Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Each city
    or airbase within a distance of five hexagons from your capital may produce one
    unit each turn, as long as your funds allow it. Each turn yields new funds,
    whose amount is proportional to the number of cities and airports you have
    occupied.
    .
    Units are moved on the map, which is based on "fake hexagons"; the hexagons are
    in fact square, but offset on each row so that each square borders six other
    squares. Each terrain type has different movement and defence values, which
    makes movement and combat more complicated.
    .
    The outcome of combat is determined by the attack strength which varies between
    different unit types, and by their experience. Each time a unit survives combat,
    it gains experience points and eventually gains in experience level, which makes
    the chance of winning in combat higher. As each unit is in fact a squadron of
    ten, a typical combat will only destroy a certain number of the members of the
    unit.
    .
    An additional moment in the gameplay is the recharging phase. Units which have
    lost members can be built up to full force in a city or airbase, and those which
    have run out of ammunition can do the same. Ammunition can also be replenished
    in the battlefield using supply trucks.
    .
    A total of thirteen airbourne and land-based units are available. Some units
    cannot fight other units; tanks can do nothing against bombers, and mechanised
    infantry can't protect itself well against a howitzer two squares away.
    .
    The game can be played both against the computer or against another human player
    by linking two Game Gears together.

    Waisen, the daughter of the original Aleste pilot Ray Waisen.\n
    As usual, your task is to exterminate level upon level of nasties with your
    space ship. The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still
    have powerup pods which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon. On
    the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no longer released from ground
    bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary
    weapon is a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split
    fire to napalm rockets and target seeking power balls. Both primary and
    secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing
    both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the
    sprites are larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game
    compensates somewhat by introducing multidirectionally scrolling sections.

    .
    To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must
    venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical
    forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow
    in order to confront and defeat the witch.
    .
    Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can
    be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects
    lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and
    throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them
    around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right
    spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In
    some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object
    is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets
    access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or
    coins to collect for points.

    Before Tails met Sonic the Hedgehog he lived on Cocoa Island, a place that isn't

    relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems like it's coming from inside the
    island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island. He also
    tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain
    it's power. Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to
    build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot
    differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the US and European
    version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate
    ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails
    Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him
    birds are invading the island.
    .
    Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional
    platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on
    puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and
    throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with
    rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the
    twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only
    allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most
    vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails
    cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.

  description:
    Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack
    is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.
    .
    The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which
    can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as
    possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at
    random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you
    place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area,
    he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of
    blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a
    meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear
    approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although
    the blocks that were on top of them will drop.
    .
    Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human
    player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of
    ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.
    .
    The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have
    to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in
    certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction
    with the press of a button.

    Panzer Dragoon Mini is the Japan-only 8-bit version of Sega's popular 32-bit
    rail shooter, but due to (massive) hardware limitations, the game has more in
    common with other classic Sega game, Space Harrier. Taking further away from the
    original games, there is no rider and the game lacks any plotline.\n
    The player starts by choosing one of three dragons, and from there must shoot at
    incoming enemies (although for most time, just avoiding incoming fire is an
    easier way to progress in the game). At the end of the level (each with two
    bosses), a password appears and allows the game to be resumed later.

  description:
    PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre
    since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second
    setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a
    multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing.
    .
    Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the
    programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and
    trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.
    .
    When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US
    golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.

    time you roar, you have to wait for your "roar meter" to charge.

    Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young

    controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant,
    which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the

    .
    Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump,
    other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car.
    Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or
    performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if
    holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing
    with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is
    slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but
    a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.\n
    Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right
    (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast
    as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels
    feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing
    enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several
    items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and
    lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).

    Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These

    selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game.
    .
    Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at
    them, which will take out most baddies with one or just a few hits, even though
    the weapon's range is limited. Other tools Batman can use are a grappling hook
    to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his
    cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.
    .
    Unlike in the Master System version, Batman can take more than one hit: he has a

    sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.
    .
    These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track
    painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you
    racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well,
    with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of
    you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to
    avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.
    .
    Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one
    player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting
    your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you
    should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after
    every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within
    your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a
    time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.
    .
    The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4
    points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car
    off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which
    involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level,
    although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared
    the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks
    are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system
    as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

  description:
    Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, as well as 3 Formula One world
    championships, so he was the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic
    arcade racing game. As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but
    depicted using sprites rather than polygons.
    .
    There are three main modes:
    .
    1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race
    followed by three laps.
    .
    2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the
    championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular
    season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have
    roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist.
    There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive
    SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player
    must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner
    of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer
    in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too
    many objects or other cars frequently.
    .
    3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for
    championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just
    the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having
    to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps
    (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or
    wet, only on some circuits).
    .
    While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same:
    Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or
    Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers. The car can be
    instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.

    Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some
    thug of a woodland king had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn't
    have a clue where. That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless
    oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk
    through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes
    through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants,
    like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and
    octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against
    these menaces.
    .
    There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't
    be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission.
    During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets,
    skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the
    skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant.
    When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the
    next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality
    will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms,
    potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs,
    there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death
    will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At
    the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his
    fireballs or lightning bolts.
    .
    There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see,
    warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a
    special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a
    pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear
    and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as
    you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected
    all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often
    than not, you'll get further in the round.

    The first of the three Shining Force games for GameGear, this is a Japanese-only
    gaiden (side-story) to the main series. The events take place in a time period
    between the first and the second Shining Force games (twenty years after the
    events of the first game), in a kingdom called Cypress. The ambassador of
    Cypress kidnaps Anri, the princess of Gardiana, casting a spell on her that

    the princess, aided by the warrior team of the first Shining Force.
    .
    The game is a strategy RPG with a typical Shining Force-style combat: the
    largest part of the game is spent fighting enemy forces. You move your party (up
    to twelve characters) around, attacking or casting spells. Once in contact with
    the enemy, a short automatic battle sequence occurs. You gain experience points

  file: Stargate (World).zip
  developer: Acclaim
  publisher: Acclaim
  description:
    The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D
    Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical
    symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks
    higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate.
    The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the
    screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the
    stack and counts toward completing the address.
    .
    There are two game modes building on this basic concept:
    .
    1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as
    many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with
    completed addresses.
    .
    Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player
    connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent
    through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is
    added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing
    their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete
    stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to
    complete the address.

    Differently from its Genesis counterpart, the game is played from a first or

    player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view
    ("through his eyes").
    .
    Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the
    Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking
    list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can
    choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental
    attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery
    and stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and
    dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs,
    straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches,
    career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.
    .
    The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control
    schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).

    clinging to walls, which also give you to access new parts of the world. The

    .
    Factory Panic consists of four rounds, and each round consists of eight stages.
    Before a stage starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line
    and what product they are waiting for. Rounds one and three are played in
    “Switch Mode”: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the
    conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its
    initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can
    only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later
    stages. Rounds two and four are played in “Bridge Mode”: remove and install
    small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.
    .
    If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will
    decrease. Sometimes, the belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes
    your scream attack more powerful, or a weight that can be placed on a switch.

    In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack),
    "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite
    self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human
    enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters
    do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak
    characters or take some hits in order to protect his master.\n

  game: Andre Agassi Tennis
  file: Andre Agassi Tennis (USA).zip
  developer: Tecmagik
  publisher: Tecmagik
  description:
    A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early
    90s with his "Image is everything" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and
    colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes eight players (male and female and
    as as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to movement speed
    and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand.
    .
    Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all
    kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise
    positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court,
    swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on
    the head.\n
    Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth,
    Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according
    to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a "Skins" game, where each
    point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.

  game: Woody Pop

  developer: SEGA
  publisher: SEGA
  description:
    Every system must have a Breakout clone, and every self-respecting developer
    must have one, especially in the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito's
    Arkanoid. Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.
    .
    With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your
    ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come
    out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks", wind-up toy soldiers or
    robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross
    your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big
    black hole as in most other games of this kind – instead the whole covers only a
    part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the
    corners.
    .
    Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms
    to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.
    .
    Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special
    blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat
    or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its path without
    ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire,
    allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits
    bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would
    otherwise have required several.

  developer: Flying Edge
  publisher: Flying Edge
  description:
    The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same
    name. The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family
    members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g.
    the woods, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right
    while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. Some of them can be dispatched of by a
    jump on their heads.
    .
    The main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design.
    There is also a life meter which allows to get hit more often before dying.
