    destruction. On his journey he meets the beautiful elven girl Windleaf and the
    robot Harv-5, who help him to reach his ultimate goal.
    .
    Although it all seems like a typical Japanese RPG, it is not. Shadow Madness was
    developed and produced in the USA, although, beyond any doubt, the Final Fantasy
    series has been the main source of inspiration here. The battles are random,
    like in many Japanese RPGs, and the battle system is almost the same like in
    Final Fantasy games: menu-based, with several sub-menu choices. The graphics are
    in 3D with polygonal characters in anime/manga style (what some people call
    "deformed").

  developer: Atlus

  description:
    The follow-up to 1996's Revelations Series: Persona, Persona 2 is a role-playing
    game pitting high-school teenagers against demons. While investigating the rumor
    of a curse at the Seven Sister's High School, magazine editor Mary Amano comes
    face-to-face with a murderer. A mysterious man by the name of Tatsuya Suou saves
    her, but from this moment on her life is irrevocably changed.\n
    As with many RPGs, players can gather a party of characters with distinct
    personalities and attacks. When a random battle begins, the player must first
    decide upon specific attacks and character turn-order before the fighting
    begins. Battles will continue until one side is eliminated, although there is
    also an option to partake in more traditional turn-based battles. Personas, the
    characters' powerful alter egos, can be used in battle to perform some of the
    more devastating attacks in the game. That said, not all encounters in the game
    need to be solved through fisticuffs.\n
    By using the game's Contact system, players can negotiate with demons and ask
    them questions. Each character in the party has a different way of negotiating
    and using the correct negotiator can mean the difference between a successful or
    failed negotiation. Success will sometimes result in the player receiving money,
    information, or Tarot Cards -- powerful items that can be used to summon new
    Personas.

    different moves. Every NBA player is included here, along with all their
    signature moves. Some of the newer basic moves range from the Drop Step to the
    Killer Crossover.\n
    Authentic 3D players and arenas (with animated crowds) are recreated in the game
    and scaled to each player's actual height, weight and body style, in addition to
    clothing such as socks, wristbands, armbands, kneepads and hairstyles.\n
    Commentary is courtesy of Ian Eagle, and the different camera angles are
    presented in a TV telecast style. Dunks are also a huge part of the game with
    over 42 different ones within. If you cannot find one that you like then you can
    create up to 12 of your own, courtesy of the unique Create Dunk mode.\n
    Another big change here from previous versions is the Touch Shooting meter
    feature, which allows you to get a good feel for your shot. Holding the
    X-button, you must release it when the bar goes into either the green or yellow
    zone. If you release it in another zone, chances for hitting your shot are
    greatly decreased.\n
    Play with up to eight of your friends using two Multi Tap adapters. Enhance the
    gameplay by using a Dual Shock Analog Controller and make sure you save the game
    to any memory card. With playoffs, exhibition and full seasons, NBA Shootout

    Vanishing Point is an arcade-style racing game that revolves around unlocking
    cars and tracks by progressing through tournament heats. As the game begins, the
    only available cars are a Ford Mustang Cobra SVT or Ford Explorer, and there's
    only one track on which to race. But earning first-place finishes unlocks
    additional tracks, cars like the Audi TT, BMW 325i and Dodge Viper GTS, and
    extra features such as the Tune-Up Shop.\n
    The other major feature of the game is Stunt Driver mode, which consists of a
    series of timed challenges like jumps and slalom courses. The faster you
    complete each challenge, the most stunt points you receive to go towards
    unlocking additional stunts. Single Race and Time Trial modes are also
    available.\n
    The only initially playable two-player mode is Single Race, but two additional
    challenges called Balloon Buster and Chicken can be unlocked. Balloon Buster has
    you racing on a track filled with colored balloons. Popping balloons of your
    color subtracts a second from your time, while popping an opponent's adds two
    seconds. Chicken pits two racers on a track going in opposite directions.\n
    Three or more players can compete in League play or Winner Stays On (in which
    the winner keeps racing as long as they keep winning), and four or eight players
    can compete in the tournament-like Knockout mode. The Internet Challenge lets
    you create an online profile and see how you rank against other players by
    competing in online-specific challenges. This mode does not include head-to-head
    racing over the Internet.\n

    senior Senator, and a power struggle arises as the station careens toward the

    Sentient's main feature is the artificial intelligence controlling multiple
    individual crew members aboard the station, each with their own assignments and
    behaviors. You interact with the AI characters through an elaborate parser
    interface, which allows you to ask them everything from the location of a vital
    piece of equipment, to their opinion of another member of the crew. To succeed,
    you must take advantage of the crew's help through this social system.\n
    Through interaction with more than 60 characters and exploration of 200
    real-time rendered locations you need to try and save the ship, and yourself.
    The game automatically randomizes sub-plots so that it will be different every

    anything you can use to kill that dragon.\n
    Talk to the people of the Discworld (a flat world on which Ankh Morpork lies),
    though most are useless because they're all mad. And that's exactly the funny
    part of the game, conversations which lead to nowhere and objects you find on
    your quest must often be used on such strange things that it's not even logical
    anymore. This game is meant for gamers who love English humour and like playing
    an adventure.\n

    goal. The opponent is trying to direct the ball past you and into your goal the
    player who reaches the level's preset point total first wins the match. There
    are six zones filled with all kinds of PONG challenges, each with three distinct
    and increasingly difficult variations on that level. Most one-on-one games also
    include power-ups that you can collect, which will benefit you in some fashion
    against your opponent.

    can be advanced by running with it or throwing it to a teammate. Points can be
    scored by carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line, catching a pass
    thrown over that goal line, kicking the ball through the opponent's goal posts
    or tackling an opposing ball carrier in his own end zone.\n
    XS Jr. League Football is designed to provide a fun, pick-up-and-play adaptation

    Nicktoons Racing is another Mario Kart clone using cartoon characters from

    of the characters to win races on tracks filled with scattered power-ups and
    ramps. A meter at the top of the screen shows the current position and the
    amount of nitro fuel available. Extra fuel can be collected as shiny orbs on the
    road. The gift boxes contain random power-ups, like coconuts to throw at the
    other racers, flash lights to temporally blind them, and traps like baby powder,
    trash cans and green goo to slow down the competition.
    .
    The game has four modes for single player. The main cups mode is the
    championship, where the objective is to arrive at least in third place to
    qualify for the next race. In time trial mode, the goal is to complete laps as
    fast as possible, with a ghost car showing the fastest performance to be
    surpassed. Race for fun is a practice mode, where any of the tracks can be
    explored without the pressure to win. In relay mode, the player switches
    characters after each lap.
    .
    There are three modes for multiplayer. The cups and relay modes are similar to
    their solo counterparts, but splitting the screen horizontally in the middle to
    show the two players. The versus mode is the "one on one" mode, where two
    players compete directly against each other without any other racers.

    organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives
    intact.\n
    Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother
    and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large
    metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time.
    An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert
    Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of
    the crusade.\n
    Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to
    overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas
    of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to
    create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages,
    the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she
    would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.\n
    But what are the queen's true intentions?

    Carnage Heart is a video game for the PlayStation, developed by Artdink. Its
    gameplay is a mecha-based, turn-based strategy game, where the player takes the
    role of a commander in a war fought by robots. The robots, called Overkill
    Engines (OKEs), cannot be directly controlled in battle; they must be programmed
    beforehand to behave in a certain way under certain conditions using a flow
    diagram system.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    The game also features a fairly complex negotiation system that allows the
    player to purchase, research, or upgrade new equipment and parts. The OKEs
    themselves can be upgraded as well through this system, allowing for extended
    use of the same model for as long as possible. The various companies involved in
    the negotiation process can also provide valuable information about the
    purchases of the enemy, allowing the player to better plan for the next
    advancement in enemy technology.

  description:
    In the quiet country of Tradguld, there are many sleepy little towns. Langoud
    rests on the coast, Sharan is the floating city where most of the trade and
    business is done, and Myscatonia is clouded in mystery and wonder. Each city has
    nothing in common with the other except for the fact they share the same
    country. That is until the Dianova sets their sights on them. Dianova is a dark
    evil empire bent on conquering the world through swords and magic.\n
    PLOT:\n
    Meis Triumph lives in the nature-rich town of Kant deep within the countryside
    of Tradguld. He has no worries and lives with his loving family who happens to
    be powerful Spirit Blacksmiths. Then the Dianova brought their war-machine
    crashing down on his quiet life. Everyone was forced to flee in terror and Meis
    became separated from the family he loved. He fled to Boyzby where he vows to
    free his people from the terror and oppression of the Dianovan Empire and where
    he meets the beautiful Sodina. Now the adventure truly begins.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    Thousand Arms by Atlus is an RPG with a faceted story and intricate gameplay. As
    in all RPGs, it has a turn-based combat system but only the character in the
    fist position may attack. The other two members of your party are used for
    defensive back-up.\n
    You play as Meis Triumph, heir to the Triumphs, a family of Spirit Blacksmiths.
    You can add two other members to the war party. You must travel the world and
    talk to people in the cities and towns to get valuable allies and information
    that will aid you on your quest. Stop in the village shops to get new armor,
    weapons and other items to truly make your band of heroes unstoppable.\n
    You also have to go on dates as all great heroes do. Rather than seeking love,
    these dates have another purpose. Keep your date happy and you can get special
    weapons, information and new abilities. So be sure to be a gentleman and always
    pay attention to what must be done in the mini-games to win her over!\n
    As a Spirit Blacksmith you have the ability to make weapons better by increasing
    their attack and defensive power as well as adding new features and spells. Of
    course, along the way you must battle enemies, explore dungeons and perform
    mini-quests in order to achieve your ultimate goal: the destruction of the
    Dianovan Empire and the evil Mecha.\n
    Are you hero enough to save your people? Are you suave enough to be a great
    date? Do you have the emotional and spiritual power to be a truly powerful
    Spirit Blacksmith? Pray you do; your entire race is depending on you.\n
    CHARACTERS:\n
    - Meis Triumph- (16-years-old) The heir to a family of Spirit Blacksmiths, Meis
    learned to be a womanizer from his father. Stubborn and lazy, Meis is forced to
    change his ways against his will, first when the Dark Acolytes force him to
    leave his comfortable home, and then when the spirits of the Ancient Blacksmiths
    give him the mission of finding the sacred flames. He is attracted to Sodina,
    but can't resist hitting on other beautiful women.\n
    In addition to his ability to reforge weapons to increase their power and grant
    them magical spells or special attacks, Meis can obtain "Elemental Beasts" to
    use in combat, similar to the "summons" seen in the Final Fantasy games. His
    weapon is a sword.\n
    - Sodina Dawnfried- (15-years-old) The younger sister of a great Spirit
    Blacksmith named Jyabil, Sodina is a beautiful, red-haired girl; however, she's
    also very brave. After her brother is killed by the Dark Acolytes, she decides
    to help Meis on his quest. She has feelings for Meis but finds herself often
    enraged by his lecherous behaviour. Her weapon of choice is a dagger.\n
    - Muza Grifford- (21-years-old) A knight and an old friend of Meis, he's brave
    but not too clever, and tended to freeze when in the presence of pretty girls.
    He has a very large physique. He develops feelings for Wyna. His weapon is a
    claymore, a huge sword that normal people would have a difficult time
    wielding.\n
    - Wyna Grapple- (17-years-old) The daughter of the King of the Pirates, Wyna is
    a boisterous girl who loves fighting; she joins the party just to go on
    adventures. She wears a bikini as well as an eyepatch, but just for effect,
    she's not missing any eyes. If you pay attention during dates, you'll see that
    Wyna's eyepatch changes eyes from time to time. At first she's attracted to Meis
    because of his strength, but later returns Muza's feelings. Wyna's weapon is a
    large battle hammer.\n
    - Nelsha Stylus- (Appears to be 16-years-old) A unique girl whose personality
    changes when she puts on new outfits, due to the spirits that inhabit them.
    Nelsha is a shy, nerdy-looking girl who speaks of herself in the third person.
    She dreams of becoming a "Dress Master", a title given to the best clothes
    designers in the world (similar to Metalia's title of Jewel Master). Her weapon
    is a magic sewing needle.\n
    In addition, Nelsha can change her costumes in combat, which changes her form
    completely and gives her different powers.\n
    - Kyleen Nelphe- (16-years-old) A green-haired female thief who tries to use the
    party for her own purposes, but ends up befriending and joining them. Her
    personality is cynical and sarcastic. She seems attracted to Soushi. Her weapon
    is a rapier, a sword used for fencing.\n
    - Soushi Maharoba- (18-years-old) A samurai with a lot of pride, who considers
    himself a ladykiller as well. His most notable feature is his pink kimono (a
    garment not usually worn by males). He and Meis can't stand each other at first
    but eventually come to respect each other. His weapon is a katana called
    Masamune (a popular name given to katanas in RPGs, named after the blacksmith
    from feudal Japan).

    mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their
    natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already
    started.
    .
    The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments
    range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police
    office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them
    crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional
    RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers,
    you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike
    from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite
    powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will
    deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the
    longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the
    game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items,
    or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects.
    The same is true for armor Aya finds.

  description:
    .... Over a 1000 years ago when the Strega suddenly appeared in Zamu'el, a small
    country located on the edge of the continent. These Strega possessed mysterious
    powers, and so they were revered and respected by the men and women of
    Zamu'el.\n
    Aside from their mysterious powers, the Strega also possessed knowledge far more
    advanced than that of Zamu'el, in such fields as metallurgy and agriculture. The
    Strega gladly passed this knowledge on to the inhabitants of Zamu'el,
    transforming the once poor country into a prosperous nation. Furthermore, the
    Strega, in their kindness, created objects that would allow normal humans to
    control powers similar to their own and bestowed them upon the people.\n
    Many of these objects, called Jeno at the time, were made and presented to the
    populace of Zamu'el. As the people learned to use the Jeno, they began to extend
    their borders into neighboring lands. With their new powers, they felt
    invincible, and failed to listen to the warning of the Strega whom they had once
    revered as gods. In just a short 10 years, Zamu'el had conquered the entire
    continent.\n
    However, even as they destroyed the last of their enemies, their mighty Empire
    began to crumble. Greedy, ambitious men rebelled throughout the land - each
    rebellion fought by Jeno bearers. The Jeno War, as it was eventually called,
    unleashed unimaginable destruction upon the land and its people. The very
    continent they had fought to win, was nothing more than a wasteland of disease
    and death by the time the fighting ended. In addition, the devastating power of
    the Jeno vanished, making the objects nothing more than fancy trinkets.

    parts later in the game.\n
    Elmyra and Montana Max, the game's only obstacles, must be avoided in order to

    lock them away until another character rescues them. If they capture all four

  description:
    Fresh off the slopes comes Capcom's Trick'N Snowboarder exclusively for the
    PlayStation. It features a wide variety of distinctive and realistically
    designed courses ranging from two different half-pipes and a snowboard park to
    Alpine courses and a large jump ramp specifically used for stunts and tricks.
    There are also a few hidden goodies/tracks waiting to be unlocked!\n
    In addition to the various tracks, there are a few different gameplay options
    including the Scenario, Versus, Edit, and Free modes. The Scenario mode has the
    player assuming the role of an up and coming snowboarding star. After joining
    the Extreme Tour, he sets off an adventure of fame and fortune; players travel
    around the world competing in various tournaments while gathering material for a
    snowboarding video.\n
    Winning competitions and getting good footage will depend on the player's
    ability to perform exciting stunts and tricks. Everything found in the actual
    sport of snowboarding has been included; players are able to execute 360s, grab,
    and flip their snowboard. Don't confine yourself to just one aerial maneuver --
    mix them up and keep the stunts interesting!\n
    When players aren't filming their movie and trying to get extraordinary stunts
    on film, other challenges await. The Versus mode pits two players in a heated
    one-on-one battle for ultimate snowboarding supremacy. Played from either a
    horizontal or split screen viewpoint, the object is to either get more points
    than your friend or finish a course in the quickest amount of time.\n
    For the creative types, Capcom included an Edit mode in which players may
    customize any given snowboarder. Don't like the clothing and/or color scheme?
    Change them! Think that character would look better with a different brand of
    snowboard? Roll with it -- it's up to you and your imagination! The customized
    snowboarder can then be used in any of the gameplay options including a Free
    mode in which players are given absolute freedom to practice courses and/or
    tricks.\n
    Trick'N Snowboarder supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller by incorporating
    both analog control and the vibration function into gameplay. Players may also
    utilize a Memory Card for saving data, Scenario mode progression and customized
    snowboarders.

    Big Strike Bowling offers a light-hearted look at the popular sport of bowling
    by mixing a wide array of fanciful characters (all customizable) and four venues
    (classical lanes, tropical beach setting, cosmic atmosphere, and a back-alley
    alley) with real-world physics. Players make adjustments to the curving arc of
    the ball prior to delivery, bowler position, speed, and power as they compete in
    four types of gameplay: Open Game, Team Game, Progressive Play and Tournament.
    The tournament pits the player's bowler in a bracket consisting of 32 opponents,
    with a "sudden death" roll-off provided in case of a tie in the final game.\n
    Players use money earned by winning tournament games to purchase bowling
    accessories and items, such as shoes, shirts, pants, and ball covers, as well as
    to unlock other bowlers and secrets. Player stats, including average, high game,
    earnings (from progressive and tournament games), percentage of strikes and
    spares per game, and number of wins and losses, can be saved. Even though the
    characters are exaggerated and the settings somewhat improbable, action in Big
    Strike Bowling presents believable challenges ranging from savvy competition to
    the ignominy of fouling at the line.

    moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for
    either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win...
    except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders:
    flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.
    .
    On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn
    the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to
    battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.
    .
    The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds
    and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German
    industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed
    with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of
    the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than
    the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.

    workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control,
    but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the
    PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed
    "Material Defender", to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and
    rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.

    Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the
    Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various
    interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship
    however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing.
    The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout
    each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like
    weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon),
    the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range
    combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the
    longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons,
    except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also
    capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs
    (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles
    (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact
    with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass
    destruction).
    .
    The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once
    completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the
    mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt
    to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the
    goals.

    In Monsterseed, players assume the role of Daniel, a young "ruler" who begins
    the game by getting himself beaten unconscious, but is rescued by the lovely Kal
    and her rugged grandfather, Wolf. Daniel learns that the thugs who attacked him
    are part of an evil gang terrorizing his benefactors' little town. The gang's
    leader Murdoch is collecting ancient statues to open a gateway to the Dark
    World, hoping to resurrect an immensely powerful monster. Driven by a sense of
    duty to repay and protect Wolf and Kal, Daniel pursues Murdoch through
    labyrinthine mines and ruins, a booby-trapped mansion, and even through the Dark
    World itself, fighting wild monsters and collecting monster seeds along the
    way.\n
    At first Daniel buys his monsters at the town hatchery, but as the game
    progresses, he obtains increasingly potent seeds to hatch on his own. By
    adjusting hatching temperatures, different monsters can be produced from each
    seed. Daniel can also add solutions to a seed during hatching to boost certain
    characteristics of his monsters.\n
    Monsters have several characteristics affecting their behavior. For example,
    willpower indicates how determined a monster is in battle; an "unforgiving"
    monster is quick to enter battle, while a "cowardly" one may ignore Daniel's
    commands or even beg to be recalled. Response time indicates how quickly a
    monster will materialize after being summoned; a "quite slow" monster may not
    materialize for several rounds after Daniel has summoned it, but a "quite fast"
    monster responds immediately.

  description:
    The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into
    place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the
    same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right,
    which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.
    .
    There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms
    meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular
    order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd
    number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of
    the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making
    contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter
    blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements
    meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move
    possible (by forming a stack, for example)
    .
    The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four
    levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an
    expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level
    3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in
    the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either
    by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible
    position) loses one of your 3 lives.

    Juggernaut is a slow-paced, point-and-click adventure in the same vein as the PC
    title Myst. It tells the story of a young woman named Sarah who, after having
    received an antique bottle as a gift from her boyfriend, opens it only to be
    consumed by an enigmatic, evil force. Having inadvertently caused her plight,
    players assume the role of her boyfriend who, aided by a priest, must venture
    into her mind, defeat the being that now resides there, and ultimately, save her
    soul.\n
    The gist of the gameplay consists of moving about a series of static screens,
    collecting items and objects for later use, and solving puzzles in order to
    progress further into the game. An onscreen compass allows players to determine
    in which cardinal direction they're able to proceed. Movement between these
    screens is facilitated by pressing the appropriate direction on the D-pad. If
    the scene contains any interactive elements, a cursor is displayed that can be
    moved about the environment, allowing players to investigate or manipulate
    whatever they are.\n
    Exploring the recesses of Sarah's mind, players find themselves confronted with
    a variety of surreal, often disturbing images. The puzzles, too, are out of the
    ordinary, requiring players to find a corporeal entity for their spiritual
    essence so they may interact with objects; utilizing color and music to solve
    puzzles and the like. The title presents a host of puzzles that range in
    difficulty and scope, some requiring the use of acquired implements, while
    others demand logic.\n
    The most important item in your possession is the pendant from your
    girlfriend.You can use this at any time to save your game.\n

    Worms World Party is an artillery game, which is a type of Turn-based strategy

    worms and using a collection of weaponry to eliminate the opposing team(s). The
    worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and
    parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations. The worms have an arsenal
    of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to
    Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as
    Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these
    weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected
    from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as
    grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape
    can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing
    environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may
    contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels
    which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to
    fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is

  description:
    Jersey Devil, as the title implies, is loosely based upon the legendary New
    Jersey beast of the same name. Instead of the horrific beast the legend
    describes, the protagonist of the title is cute purple creature with long-ears
    and small wings. Dr. Knarf -- the villain of the piece -- has created a legion
    of mutated vegetables to do his evil bidding, and it falls to Jersey Devil to
    stop the maniacal scientist.
    .
    To do this, the purple protagonist must venture through a series of 3D platform
    stages spread across themed environments such as a museum, cemetery, forest, and
    even a haunted house. Endowed with an ample set of abilities, Jersey Devil must
    jump, glide, and tail whip his way through the hordes of vegetables and undead
    minions, the latter comprising such mainstays as zombies, bats, and spiders.

  description:
    After an outbreak of UFO sightings and alien abductions, panic spread like
    wildfire across the globe. What exactly was happening? Have aliens come to take
    over Earth? Realizing the need to address the situation, delegates from the
    world's superpowers gathered in Geneva to decide on a plan of action.\n
    An agreement was reached to form a secret group to investigate this potential
    alien threat, and if necessary, use deadly force to stop them. This covert
    organization would be called the Extraterrestrial Combat unit (X-COM for short),
    composed of the most talented pilots, troops, scientists and engineers the world
    had to offer.\n
    X-COM: UFO Defense is based on the 1994 PC game originally developed by Mythos
    Games Ltd. The player assumes control of the X-COM task force, building bases
    and tracking various UFOs on a 3D map of Earth. Once a UFO is spotted
    (represented by a red cross), you must try to intercept it so that it crashes
    over dry land. You'll then need to send your heavily armed squad to the site,
    where you'll witness the downed craft and surrounding terrain from an isometric
    perspective.\n
    Moving your troops is accomplished through a point-and-click interface with each
    side alternating turns. Your three goals are to (1) engage the aliens face to
    face, (2) either stun or kill them, and (3) retrieve whatever technology or
    weapons you find so your scientists can replicate them. After all, you have to
    fight fire with fire! The PlayStation version supports both the mouse and memory
    card, with the latter allowing you to save the game at any point (as long as you
    have five blocks free).

    their bearings after being blown away by your aggressive start. You fly around
    corners, shredding up the dirt which paves the course. Your arch-rival closes
    in, but you cut him off on the sharp "hairpin" turn and he's left spinning out
    on the side. You throttle up and do a little show-boating for the crowd as the
    checkered flag is waved in your honor! If you thought that little teaser sounded

    Geared toward young children, Disney's Pooh's Party Game: In Search of the
    Treasure is a board game adventure similar to Mario Party. As Pooh, Tigger,
    Rabbit, Piglet, Owl, or Roo, players must make their way around three
    increasingly difficult board games in an attempt to finish first. One to four
    players can participate in the adventure, or simply compete against each other
    in the mini-games.\n
    Adventure mode has players moving around the different squares of the board and
    challenging the other characters in one of five mini-games. The outcome of the
    mini-game determines the number of squares each player can move on the next
    turn. First place earns six squares, second place earns four squares, third
    place earns two, and last place earns one.\n
    Collectible honey pots along the way boost a character's moving potential, and
    there can be positive or negative effects when landing on a particular square.
    For instance, players may have to move back a certain number of spaces, lose
    honey pots, or receive an extra move. Players will also encounter Gopher, as
    well as bees, Heffalumps, and Woozles in their journey around the board.\n
    Five mini-games include Owl's Fruit 'n' Hoot, Pooh's Pinball Party, Tigger's
    Thunder & Frightening, Rabbit's Roller Races, and Piglet's Pumpkin Hunt. While
    only two mini-games are available for quick play in the beginning, the others
    become unlocked after playing the adventure mode. Difficulty levels for the
    mini-games can be adjusted to Easy, Normal, or Hard.

  description:
    Xako and Mia live for one thing and one thing only: to catch serious air
    performing mind-blowing stunts on their hoverdeks. A hoverdek is best described
    as a hovering skateboard, it works the same way but there are no wheels and it's
    constantly floating. Back to the story at hand, these two dekkies are fanatical
    about their skills; they would go adventuring with their buddies and show off
    new tricks.\n
    Would meaning past tense; dekkies are now being oppressed by the maniacal
    Krakken. With a sour hatred for hoverdeks, the cheese-smelling ingrate kidnaps
    dekkies and stores them in his mundane world. Xako and Mia are at the end of
    their ropes and decided that its time to destroy Krakken and rescue their fellow
    dekkies!\n
    Psybadek combines third-person 3D platforming with the trickery of a snow or
    skateboarding game. Spanning four unique worlds, players will overcome a series
    of platforming obstacles, pickup important items, and perform a barrage of death
    defying stunts aboard a hoverdek. Stunts include a ground-shaking SuperStomp, a
    360-degree spiral, a circular back flip known as the Firewall, a near impossible
    spinning Powerblast, and a weather altering Elektra Storm.\n
    Broken into eight levels apiece (with a bonus level in each), the four worlds
    consist of an Ice World, a Jungle World, a Desert World, and the Underground.
    Level and world selection is chosen from the Psyba-Zone, which holds it all
    together as a hub. Each level features a unique design ranging from
    psychedelically rendered jungles to ancient temples.\n
    Krakken does not tolerate the insolent; anyone with enough guts to challenge him
    will be met with extreme resistance. His army consists of waddling penguins,
    genetically altered freaks that throw rocks and snowballs, and the
    ever-dangerous monkey. Fortunately, Xako and Mia are packing a few unique
    weapons such as the anti-matter missile, the C. King plastic explosive, and a
    Ballistic Bogey Bomb. They can also collect a number of stars that increase the
    overall score that awards the player with some extra goodies!\n
    Psybadek also features a few free-roaming areas and a local skate park when the
    going gets a little rough! So what are you waiting for? Grab your hoverdek,
    catch some massive air, and save your buddies from the evil Krakken!

    Points can be scored in other ways as well however, such as lighting all of the
    stars on a wall or by hitting Bounce Domes with the ball.

    The game is constantly moving as the steel ball is passed back and forth or
    stolen with a heavy body-slam or a quick elbow to the teeth. Special power-ups

    Choose between roller blades, a luge (basically a sit-down skateboard), a
    mountain bike, and the skateboard. The player can also determine which character
    they want to race with, each one having a unique skill on one of the apparatus.
    For example one might be top-notch at roller blading but be bad at bike-riding
    so there is no point choosing the bike with him/her. In a season, the player
    competes in the five locations - three times, twelve in all and each time the

    of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to
    create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages,
    the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she
    would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.\n
    But what are the queen's true intentions?

  game: Sheep

  developer: Empire Interactive
  publisher: Empire Interactive
  description:
    Sheep is a combination strategy and puzzle game, featuring light elements of war
    or battle simulations, built around a wacky story in which space-faring alien
    explorers from millennia ago devolve into domesticated sheep on Earth. Now their
    ancestors are trying to round them up by secretly enlisting the aid of two
    humans (Bo Peep and Adam Half Pint) and two animals (a sheepdog and a pet)
    through subliminal mind control.\n
    Players take the role of the Earthly "herders" to lead the flocks through six
    worlds with multiple levels, eventually reaching special rendezvous point where
    they'll be loaded onto UFOs for the trip back to their home world of Ovis Aries.
    No direct control is exerted on the sheep so players must manipulate objects and
    obstacles, as well as rely on the strengths of each herder, to accomplish the
    tasks. Levels have time limits and a minimum number of sheep to be saved from
    each flock.\n
    Four breeds of sheep, each with distinctive characteristics, must be herded
    through all levels. Modern Pastoral are intimidated domesticated sheep, Modern
    Factorals are fashion-minded sheep too dumb to discern danger from safety, Long
    Wools are a sub-culture breed that love rock music, and Neo Genetics embrace new
    technology. Other features include three difficulty settings, bonus games for
    collecting all special "Golden Sheep" within each world, and two-player
    action.\n
    Features\n
    * "Artificial stupidity" AI reflects levels of sheep dumbness\n
    * Six worlds with multiple levels; four breeds of sheep\n
    * Use indirect herding techniques to lead sheep to safety\n
    * Two-player capability and bonus levels

    series has been the main source of inspiration here. The battles are random,
    like in many Japanese RPGs, and the battle system is almost the same like in
    Final Fantasy games: menu-based, with several sub-menu choices. The graphics are
    in 3D with polygonal characters in anime/manga style (what some people call

    Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.

    The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while
    strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He
    comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it
    was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He
    hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize
    that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to
    return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the
    existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will
    also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly
    unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.
    .
    Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random
    battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character
    levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each
    battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of
    attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently.
    Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only
    as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount
    of stamina, which recovers as other characters act.
    .
    Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them
    can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the
    ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous
    play.

    Bubsy 3D: Furbitten Planet, also known simply as Bubsy 3D, is a platform video
    game developed by Eidetic and published by Accolade and Telstar for the
    PlayStation video game console. Designed by Michael Berlyn, it was released on
    October 13, 1996 in North America and in August 1997 in Europe. It is the fourth
    and final game in the Bubsy series, starring its eponymous protagonist. It is
    one of the first 3D platform games, though with limited movement. The game's
    complete name is a parody of Forbidden Planet, a 1956 sci-fi film. A Sega Saturn
    version was planned but was cancelled.\n
    The game was very poorly received and was regarded as one of the worst games of
    all time by GameTrailers, IGN, GamesRadar, and humorist Seanbaby. Many of the
    major elements of the game received criticism; it has been criticized for its
    graphics, its controls, and the personality of Bubsy, the latter which IGN felt
    was ruined from the previous Bubsy games. It holds an aggregate score of 50.90%
    at Game Rankings based on five reviews. Berlyn attributes its low quality to its
    release coinciding with Super Mario 64, which he found to be far superior;
    however, due to development being nearly done and Accolade wanting it to be
    released, there was no time to improve upon it.

    The protagonist of the previous two games was officially assigned a name in
    WCIII, Colonel Christopher Blair (Mark Hamill). The opening cutscene, the first
    FMV cutscene in the Wing Commander series, depicts a saddening scene: Thrakhath
    nar Kiranka (John Rhys-Davies), Crown Prince of the hostile Kilrathi Empire,
    presiding over the execution by disintegration of a group of Terran
    Confederation prisoners of war. One, however, is left alive: Blair's lover
    Colonel Jeannette "Angel" Devereaux (Yolanda Jilot), due to her status among the
    Kilrathi as a respected warrior, who is executed by Prince Thrakhath using his
    claws to disembowel her (though her death scene is not shown until later in the
    game). The scene then cuts to the planet Vespus, where Blair and Brigadier
    General James "Paladin" Taggart inspect the downed wreckage of the TCS
    Concordia. The carrier is a total loss.

    Butch, and Cap'n Hands. Vox, however, is not present in the game and is replaced
    by two new female characters: a pink-haired, cannibalistic sex symbol named The
    Consumer, and a malfunctioning android nun named Sister Magpie. Via cheat code,
    Sister Magpie can unlock hidden character Fwank from the previous game for use
    in Re-Loaded. If unlocked, Fwank is the best character in Re-Loaded, with the
    most speed and best armour. All of the returning characters have new weapons
    and/or variations of their costumes. There are twelve blood-soaked new worlds to
    annihilate, much bigger than the levels encountered in the previous game, and
    with the added bonus of being able to morph the surrounding terrain with
    high-powered weaponry and explosives.

    Decorated by the familiar makeup-enhanced, cartoon-like mugs of the "hottest
    band in the world," the game features two tables: "Last Stop Oblivion" and
    "Netherworld." Four game modes are available: Novice, Regular, Arcade and
    Tournament.\n
    The storyline for KISS Pinball revolves around the band battling the Dark Lord
    and claiming the "Kissneth" as their own. Your objectives include getting past
    security to snag an autograph, lighting "PASS" to access backstage, collecting
    weapons, shooting a spinner to upgrade record sales, hitting the Statue of
    Liberty repeatedly to reveal the Destroyer Skull to start 3-ball, spelling
    "MAYHEM" to light video mode, collecting lost souls, discovering hidden
    power-ups, locking balls with Gene's tongue and much more.\n
    Your perspective is directly above each table. You can see approximately
    one-third of the playfield at a time with the screen scrolling to follow the
    course of the ball. Each table has the standard two-flipper layout, with the
    ability to nudge the table up, left, and right to influence ball movement. But

  description:
    A game based much closer to the original animated series was announced on April
    9, 1996 for the PlayStation and Windows 95. The game, which was loosely based on
    ?The Demiurge? episode, was being developed by Cryo Interactive and published by
    Viacom New Media. The game first made an appearance at E3 that same year, and
    commercial advertising was even included in the 1996 VHS release of the animated
    series.
    .
    Viacom New Media would merge with Virgin Interactive midway through the game?s
    development. The merger would ultimately lead to the cancellation of Viacom?s
    in-development games and subsequently leave Cryo without the rights to use the
    Æon Flux property. The game?s assets weren?t lost however, but were reworked
    into the 1997 title Pax Corpus, having been stripped of all copyrighted
    association with Æon Flux. Pax Corpus does retain many obvious similarities to
    the original animated series. Specifically in plot to ?The Demiurge? and also in
    many design details, which bear a striking resemblance to examples found in the
    show. For instance, the female protagonist of the game wears a purple and black
    outfit not unlike Æon?s.

    escalating chaos. There are 5 characters in all to choose from, each with their

    reduce the world to utter chaos -- massive floods, earthquakes and volcanic
    eruptions will be the result.\n
    So, who's going to stop them? You are, as the leader of the StrikePoint Team. By
    taking to the skies and launching an all-out air assault on Hex, your only
    mission is to destroy their existence and world-destroying plans. You've got a
    lot of weight riding on your shoulders, better not let the world down.\n
    In StrikePoint, you will pilot one of three different helicopters, each with its
    own strengths and weaknesses. Where one sacrifices maneuverability for the sake
    of shields and firepower, the other is stealthy and fast without a lot of
    weaponry. The other is a middle-of-the-road chopper that is balanced in every
    category.\n
    Played from various 3D perspectives (first-person, third-person), there is a
    multitude of missions to complete. For the most part, your objective will be to
    destroy any and all enemy resistance. Sometimes, your target will be a specific
    building or a search and rescue mission (captured allied intelligence). Your
    mission will not be easy as you are met with considerable resistance. Enemies
    come from both air and ground and you will have to deal with them accordingly.\n
    StrikePoint also comes equipped with a two-player feature where you and a friend

  description:
    In the future, gang warfare is settled between gangs by using advanced armored
    vehicles. A mysterious figure called the Crimelord has set up a tournament on a
    secluded island dubbed "The Death Ring"  to get all the gangs to fight each
    other to earn his favor. It's up to the player to take their gang to the top by
    infiltrating all the opposing gang's bases of operation and take out their
    network of power generators which will effectively cripple those opposing
    factions.
    .
    Gameplay is centered around vehicular combat. Bases are defended by enemy
    vehicles, gun turrets, and mortars which harass the player while they are
    searching for the power generators to destroy. Players choose a vehicle (which
    represents a gang) with each coming with their own distinctive weapons such as
    shield draining bombs, energy megabolts, corrosive sulfur gas bombs and,
    mini-thermonuclear warheads. Each of the 23 missions contain power-ups such as
    invulnerability, invisibility, double damage, nitro boosts, and guided missile
    lock jammers. Powerups are earned after collecting a number of tokens scattered
    throughout each mission.

    In the near future, mankind's tinkering with the science of genetics and the
    developmental process of genome mapping has resulted in the accidental creation
    of a new disease known as EINDS. This disease, which attacks a cell's DNA and
    halts mitosis and meiosis (the processes that allow our cells to duplicate), has
    killed nearly a billion people and no hope of a cure has been discovered.\n
    With the disease spreading rapidly, it is feared that the manipulations of DNA
    will lead to mankind's complete undoing. It's up to three mercenaries and a
    mysterious woman with no past to combine their separate efforts into one
    adventure involving danger, intrigue, and supernatural involvement, with the
    prize perhaps being salvation for human kind.\n
    Fear Effect: Retro Helix is a cinematic adventure game for the PlayStation.
    Although it has been released after the original Fear Effect title, it is in
    actuality a prequel to the events in the first game, explaining how Hana
    Tsu-Vachel, Royce Glas, and Jacob Decourt wound up together. The game takes
    place over four levels, each of which has its own CD: futuristic, gritty Hong
    Kong, the Walled City of Xi'an, the Tomb of the First Emperor of China, and the
    legendary Penglai Shan, mountain home to the immortals.

    For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children
    all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt
    shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made
    the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the
    world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost....
    magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live!
    .
    Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C
    cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy
    shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a
    "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each
    track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from.
    .
    There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's
    a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several
    computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a
    series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you
    play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the
    track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where
    you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and
    the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars
    situated in hard-to-reach places.
    .
    In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered
    throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as
    missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors
    in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to
    make them stop.

    necessary skills, you'll begin a tour of duty with the Navy and be assigned top
    priority air missions!\n
    As a fighter pilot, you'll carry out a barrage of missions set throughout Mimar,

    important people, and good old-fashioned dogfights with enemy MiGs.\n
    Players will be manning the F-14 fighter plane. Not only does this baby come
    with all the necessary tools and equipment needed for survival (radar, warning
    lights, altitude meters), it comes with a variety of missiles; there are
    standard air-to-air missiles, the air-to-ground AGMs, U238s made from depleted
    uranium, a disastrous Nuke, and the multiple target MIRV. It also comes with
    some defensive tools such as chaffs and flares that trick enemy radar.\n
    Don't worry, you're not going in the air alone! Merlin will act as your Radar
    Intercept Officer; loosely translated, he's the guy that sits behind you and
    watches out for enemy target locks. Additionally, the sweetly calm Raven and
    your arch rival Stinger will assist Maverick as his wingmen. When you get in a
    sticky situation, count on these guys to help you out!\n
    Top Gun: Fire at Will features a single-player Campaign mode and an Options
    menu. The Options menu lets players select a difficulty level (trainee, pilot,
    and ace) as well as sound and music levels and various controller
    configurations. The Campaign is the real deal; this is where you'll be taking
    mission objectives and flying in the not-so-friendly skies.\n

    Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters,
    that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story
    of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the
    'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty
    eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant
    towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional
    military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world.
    Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.
    .
    The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D
    backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact
    with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself
    occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character
    takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even

    points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon
    (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use,
    powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are
    a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.

    The protagonist of the previous two games was officially assigned a name in
    WCIII, Colonel Christopher Blair (Mark Hamill). The opening cutscene, the first
    FMV cutscene in the Wing Commander series, depicts a saddening scene: Thrakhath
    nar Kiranka (John Rhys-Davies), Crown Prince of the hostile Kilrathi Empire,
    presiding over the execution by disintegration of a group of Terran
    Confederation prisoners of war. One, however, is left alive: Blair's lover
    Colonel Jeannette "Angel" Devereaux (Yolanda Jilot), due to her status among the
    Kilrathi as a respected warrior, who is executed by Prince Thrakhath using his
    claws to disembowel her (though her death scene is not shown until later in the
    game). The scene then cuts to the planet Vespus, where Blair and Brigadier
    General James "Paladin" Taggart inspect the downed wreckage of the TCS
    Concordia. The carrier is a total loss.

    The King of Fighters, officially abbreviated KOF, is a series of fighting games
    by SNK Playmore, formerly SNK. The series was originally developed for SNK's
    Neo-Geo MVS arcade hardware, which served as the main platform for the series
    until 2004, when SNK retired the MVS in favor of the Atomiswave arcade board and
    will move the series to the Taito Type X2 with the release of The King of
    Fighters XII. Ports of the arcade games and original The King of Fighters games
    have been released for the Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket, Game Boy and Game Boy
    Advance, N-Gage, Sega Saturn and Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation and PlayStation 2,
    PC, and Xbox. One of the most recent games in the series are KOF: Maximum Impact
    series.\n
    The initial storyline follows Kyo Kusanagi, a young Japanese who enters The King
    of Fighters tournaments. Being the heir of the ancient Kusanagi clan, who wield
    pyrokinetic powers, Kyo manages to use its powerful techniques to become
    champion of the tournament along with his friends. Kyo and his friends find
    themsleves meeting the host of the events: a powerful criminal named Rugal
    Bernstein, who wants to find worthy opponents to kill so that he can turn them
    into statues in order to remember his ruthless victories but is defeated. In the
    1995 KOF tournament, it is revealed the entity of Orochi: an ancient
    eight-headed demon who was sealed by the three ancient artifacts of Japan. Rugal
    tries to use it but dies in the process. In this game, a fighter named Iori
    Yagami appears aiming to kill Kyo and destroy the Kusanagi clan, as revenge for
    the Yagami clan.\n
    The King of Fighters '95 is a 1995 fighting game produced by SNK for the Neo Geo
    arcade and home console. It is the sequel to The King of Fighters '94 and the
    second game in The King of Fighters series. It is also the first game in the
    series to be ported to other home consoles besides the Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo
    CD, with versions released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Game Boy.\n
    The King of Fighters '95 marks the beginning of a story arc that later became
    known as the "Orochi Saga". However, the only elements from the Orochi saga
    known in this game are the introduction of Kyo's rival, Iori Yagami, and Rugal's
    use of the Orochi power.\n
    Rugal Bernstein, thought to have perished in an explosion in the previous game,
    had in fact survived and sent out invitations to the teams from the previous
    game signed simply 'R'. Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new
    tournament, the American Sports team, now replaced by the "Rival Team"
    consisting of Iori Yagami, Billy Kane (from the Fatal Fury), and Eiji Kisaragi
    (from Art of Fighting 2).\n
    The Playstation version features an Art Gallery with illustration gallery,
    unused art and a secret ending demo unlockble, this version is also vibration

    game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a
    single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a
    time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes
    around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead
    camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and
    steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts
    the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and
    finishing missions.
    .
    Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose
    allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's
    reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by
    the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police,
    they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the
    army.
    .
    New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough
    money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money.
    There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a
    flamethrower and a car with machine guns.

  description:
    Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game developed by System Soft.
    .
    Gameplay engages players by permitting them to summon and move monsters around a
    board in an effort to capture towers and to eventually defeat the opponents
    (which are controlled either by other humans or by the computer program). Moves
    are based on a hexagonal board structure, such that every tile on the board is
    adjacent to six other tiles. Other notable features were the large variety of
    monsters, upgrading ("leveling up") of veteran units and control of a "Master"
    character who, if killed, can end the game for that player.
    .
    The focus of the game is strategic, despite the fantasy-type characters that
    might imply an RPG element. Other than the existence of the Master character and
    magic in the game, the gameplay is very similar to System Soft's more hardcore
    modern warfare strategic wargame series Daisenryaku, with the exception that
    some versions of the Master of Monsters (such as Master of Monsters ? Final)

    Juggernaut is a slow-paced, point-and-click adventure in the same vein as the PC
    title Myst. It tells the story of a young woman named Sarah who, after having
    received an antique bottle as a gift from her boyfriend, opens it only to be
    consumed by an enigmatic, evil force. Having inadvertently caused her plight,
    players assume the role of her boyfriend who, aided by a priest, must venture
    into her mind, defeat the being that now resides there, and ultimately, save her
    soul.\n
    The gist of the gameplay consists of moving about a series of static screens,
    collecting items and objects for later use, and solving puzzles in order to
    progress further into the game. An onscreen compass allows players to determine
    in which cardinal direction they're able to proceed. Movement between these
    screens is facilitated by pressing the appropriate direction on the D-pad. If
    the scene contains any interactive elements, a cursor is displayed that can be
    moved about the environment, allowing players to investigate or manipulate
    whatever they are.\n
    Exploring the recesses of Sarah's mind, players find themselves confronted with
    a variety of surreal, often disturbing images. The puzzles, too, are out of the
    ordinary, requiring players to find a corporeal entity for their spiritual
    essence so they may interact with objects; utilizing color and music to solve
    puzzles and the like. The title presents a host of puzzles that range in
    difficulty and scope, some requiring the use of acquired implements, while
    others demand logic.\n
    The most important item in your possession is the pendant from your
    girlfriend.You can use this at any time to save your game.\n
    Features:\n
    * Save your girlfriend Sarah from the Great Evil that possesses her\n

    accelerating sub-atomic particles around a tubular shaped circuit known as The
    Torus, they are developing a race of Super Warriors. Together with advanced
    genetic engineering, this central birthing canal is capable of producing an army
    of lethal genetically mutated insects.\n
    Nitrous Oxide, a pollutant by-product emitted inside The Torus, provides a high
    octane fuel for your Tunnel Runner, but unfortunately it also provides the
    perfect breeding environment for the secretly incubating species.

  description:
    Following the adventures of the first Chocobo Dungeon game, Chocobo and Mog
    continue to search for treasure. One day, Mog discovers a new Mysterious Dungeon
    and takes the treasure from inside. This releases a seal which causes the
    Bahamut to appear just as the dungeons plunges into the ocean. Chocobo is
    rescued by a young white mage, Shiroma, who is the only human living in the
    monster village. Chocobo must help Mog, find Bahamut and fix whatever has been
    unsealed from the Mysterious Dungeon.
    .
    Chocobo's Dungeon 2 is a simple action / rpg in the style of other games in the
    Mysterious Dungeon series. Chocobo must decend into dungeon areas alone or with
    a partner (controlled by the cpu or the second player), gathering treasure,
    while finding the passageway to the next floor and satisfying hunger. The game
    is viewed from the top down as all objects on the screen move at the same time.
    Chocobo can equip a single weapon and armor item, while the hunger level is
    satisfied by eating different forms of nuts. Spells can be collected, while
    successive casting increases the proficiency in that spell. Unlike other
    Mysterious Dungeon games, Chocobo keeps his level and stats between trips to the
    dungeon. Boss monsters wait at the completion of most objectives. Different
    subquests are available from the residents of Monster Town.

    Enter a surreal world where you must battle the Sentinel and his sentries over
    650 chequered, 3D landscapes.  Energy and movement are completely redefined in
    this unique blend of arcade and strategy elements. You, only known as an
    intelligent presence, move about the landscape by teleporting between robot
    "hulls".  Any object in your field of vision can be absorbed for energy, as long
    as you also see the square of the landscape that the object is standing on.  By
    aiming at any square your can see, and spending energy, you can create a new
    robot hull and teleport your presence to it, or you can create neutral objects:
    trees to block yourself from the Sentinel's gaze, or boulders that can be
    stacked.  You gain height in the landscape by creating a robot on top of a stack
    of boulders, until you can see the Sentinel's square at the highest point in the
    landscape and absorb him.  The problem is that the Sentinel slowly rotates and
    ruthlessly absorbs anything in his field of vision that is more potent than a
    tree, including yourself.  In later levels, his sentries will threaten you with
    absorption from several directions.

    realization that man was mortally flawed with weaknesses and feelings, he
    created a mysterious force known as the Seru; these stone objects would aid
    humans in decisions and day to day functions. Worn as an apparel item, they

    Filled with destructive means and hatred, the Mist covered the human's

    shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game,
    there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if
    you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double
    shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a

  game: Planet of the Apes
  file: Planet of the Apes (USA).zip
  developer: Ubisoft
  publisher: Ubisoft
  description:
    The Planet of the Apes is an action/adventure interpretation of the 1968 film
    (which is itself an adaptation of the Pierre Boule novel). While the game's
    setting and opening sequence are based very heavily on the original film, the
    storyline is new and deals with the poignant social conflicts of the futuristic
    Earth from its own perspective. The game world is a land ruled by hyper-evolved
    apes in which human beings live like wild animals, without language or
    civility.\n
    Players take the role of Ulysses, the human hero of the game. As in the movie,
    the hero is an astronaut who is transported to the post-apocalyptic Earth when
    his ship crash-lands in the wilderness. Unlike Charlton Heston's Taylor in the
    film version of the story, Ulysses realizes fairly quickly exactly when and
    where he is. The game's most surprising revelations come from other discoveries
    that Ulysses makes as he proceeds through the adventure. The depth of the plot
    becomes more apparent as Ulysses discovers that many consider his presence on
    the planet to be the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, in which a human
    messiah would fall from the sky to save mankind from its collapsed state. For
    what it's worth, Ulysses does not feel very much like a messiah.\n
    Gameplay follows conventions established by popular titles like Tomb Raider and
    Metal Gear Solid. The action is viewed from a third-person perspective, with the
    "camera" behind the hero's shoulders and panning occasionally to offer a better
    view in tight spots. While there is plenty of action and combat, the
    all-important storyline relies on character exploration and interaction for its
    progression. The game contains hundreds of lines of scripted dialog and Ulysses
    can have conversations with most non-player characters.\n
    One of three "modes" determines how Ulysses will approach a given situation. In
    "normal mode," the hero walks about at a regular pace. In "athletic mode," he is
    ready for action, running from place to place and able to jump and dodge
    quickly. In "stealth mode," Ulysses crouches down and moves as silently as
    possible, allowing him to explore hidden areas without being noticed by guards
    and other apes. All three modes of action are required to guide Ulysses safely
    through this diverse and dangerous Planet of the Apes.\n
    Features:\n
    * Based on the movie, players take control of the astronaut Ulysses\n
    * Infiltrate Ape City and stop General Ursus from exterminating humans\n
    * Battle bats, hyenas, baboons, rats, and more

    This is the home port of the popular arcade light gun game. This home version
    has special bonuses and additional secret levels not found in the arcade. Using
    a light gun (or a mouse, if available) you blast your way through the secret
    base, Area 51, which has been taken over by mutant aliens.
    .
    As you work your way to the secrets at the heart of Area 51, you'll need to
    destroy an increasingly dangerous line of aliens, upgrade your firearm, and
    cause as much collateral damage as possible. The game rewards the player for
    destroying windows, light fixtures, computers, explosive barrels, and even fire
    extinguishers. Each consecutive hit increases your streak rating (which adds to
    your score) and certain combinations of these collateral hits will open up
    secret bonus rooms.

    view of the challenging competition that real racers face every day.\n
    The game features full FOA support so all 11 of the real teams and 22 drivers
    are included. Each car is also modeled accurately from its real counterpart,
    down to its smallest details. The developers in fact insist that if you are able
    to drive well, your lap times for the different circuits should be very similar
    to the real ones from the 1999 season. The tracks are also replicated from the
    immediate area surrounding it, to the areas well beyond the normal scope of a

    and there's enough stats to make the mathematically inclined happy. However, the
    teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it
    is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still
    a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style

    The 24 Heures Du Mans is the Super Bowl of the racing world. The event, created
    in 1923, exudes an immense measure of status. In it, the best in the world
    compete in a brutal, day long race. The goal is to complete the most laps around
    the famous Le Mans track in a 24-hr. period.\n
    In Le Mans, the player is offered a choice of three different car classes. On
    the one hand, we have the GT2 class. It is the easiest of the group, offering a
    good level of handing. The second type is the GT1. The GT1 cars are designed
    with professional racing in mind. Although difficult to control, these cars are
    the most powerful of the classes. Only an experienced driver can handle the GT1
    class. Finally, we have the Prototype class of car. These vehicles lie slightly
    below the GT1 in terms of performance.\n
    Le Mans offers a number of play modes. The Arcade mode is designed for a quick
    thrill. It can satisfy the action junkies need for an adrenaline high. In it,
    the cars are completely indestructible, putting the emphasis on the racing. As
    the name implies, the Challenge races offer a bunch of difficult obstacles to
    overcome. Beating the opponent cars will open up a new series of Challenge
    tracks. The Time Attack mode pits the racer against the clock. Victory in the
    Time Attack mode will unleash a new fleet of cars.\n
    The Championship mode is a little bit deeper. In it, the player will participate
    in an entire racing season, culminating in the famous 24 Heures Du Mans. The
    Championship mode starts with the GT2 class of car. Upon beating the first
    series of races, the player will be able to move on to the other car types.
    Finally, Le Mans offers the Le Mans 24 hr mode. In game time, the Le Mans race
    lasts the entire 24-hr. period. The player can choose to shorten the outcome by
    resetting the game time. Be careful, though, as the car can take a lot of damage
    in a long race.\n
    Le Mans offers a split screen multi-player mode. In addition, it supports the
    Dual Shock Analog Controller and the Memory Card.\n

    Based on the popular computer chess program, The Chessmaster 3-D for the
    PlayStation allows players to challenge a friend or one of 12 virtual chess
    opponents. Each computer-controlled opponent is rated according to ability.
    There are also six unique chess sets (each with animated pieces) from which to
    choose, including Alphabet, Celestial, Deco, Mechanical, Modern, and Staunton.\n
    If you need assistance in deciding which pieces to move in order to secure a
    checkmate, the ChessMaster is available to lend a helping hand. You can perfect
    your chess playing skills using various teaching options; you can even view the
    computer's thought process as it "thinks" through each move.\n
    While this is obviously a 3D title, you can switch the camera angle for a more
    traditional two-dimensional perspective. The camera is adjustable in that you're
    able to zoom it in and out until you find a view that is to your liking. You can
    even switch playing sides (from black to white pieces or vise versa) or simply
    have a quick look at the other side of the board.\n
    If you want to see which pieces have been captured, you can view them in the War
    Room. The Chessmaster 3-D also features various time controls (five seconds per
    move, 40 moves in 120 minutes), replays, take back options, and auto play (which
    lets the game play itself).\n
    Features:\n
    Challenge the computer or a friend on a 3D table with adjustable levels of
    zoom\n
    Features 12 computer AI opponents\n
    Access hints while playing and view replays of key moves

    The game of Monopoly has been around ever since the Great Depression-era of the
    1920s. The PlayStation version of the game boasts token and property animations,
    rule variations, real-time board rotation and multi-player link options.\n
    The premise of the game is the same as it has always been. You have to purchase
    as much property as possible and then build it up in hopes of bankrupting your
    opponents and remaining as the only entrepreneur left. You are given $1,500 in
    cash to start with and must try to build up from there. Purchase properties
    ranging from Boardwalk to Water Works, put houses on them, and watch your money
    grow.\n
    You can play with up to seven other human or computer opponents who will all be
    aiming for you and your property. You can make deals with your opponents since
    trades and immunities are available. Just watch out though, because they may try
    to stab you behind your back.\n
    If you are in a long, tension-filled game that you need to get out of, you can
    save the game to an open block on your memory card. The game also supports a
    mouse as well as the Multi Tap device.

  developer: Sony

  description:
    Gran Turismo is fundamentally based on the racing simulator genre. The player
    must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers
    on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and
    Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade
    mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use.
    Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.
    .
    However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of
    driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits(money),
    trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular
    championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks.
    Money earned by winning championships can be used to purchase additional
    vehicles, and for parts and tuning of all vehicles.
    .
    Gran Turismo features 180 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as reversed
    versions). Two Honda del Sol cars from 1995 were included in the Japanese
    version, but were removed from the North American and European versions. They
    can be found in the North American version's code (and are unlockable via a
    GameShark cheat device). In addition to the hidden del Sols, there is also a
    1967 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1998 Mazda Roadster exclusive to Arcade mode. The
    Corvette and Roadster can also be accessed via GameShark.

    calling and the fact that there are no penalties helps to encourage this fast

    The game also has two passing interfaces, an icon-based passing method and a
    one-button method where the computer makes the pass for the player.
    .

    preferences. Guide your kickboxer from a rookie beginner to a contender for the
    heavyweight title. A two-player mode allows rivals to face-off in head-to-head
    bouts.\n
    At the onset of the game, only four of these fighters are available, but by
    beating opponents in the game's somewhat cheesy Story mode, gamers will
    eventually have 14 fighters to choose from. After completing the daunting task
    that is Story mode, players will have an even better time competing in the
    game's primary Ranking mode. Here they must fight anywhere between three and 12
    fighters to win the title belt and gain valuable experience points. After
    winning a title, they can then defend their title to gain more points or open up
    new championship tournaments. While there are no rewarding endings or additional
    special characters to be earned, Ranking Mode is enjoyable enough to bring
    players back again and again.

    ATV Mania is an all-terrain vehicle combat racing game. Modes include
    Championship, Single Race, and Time Attack.
    .
    The main mode is the Championship mode which lets the player compete in an
    underground ATV championship circuit which is being held amongst the French
    Alps. The player's goal is to win the races by any means necessary.
    .
    The player gets to choose to play as one of six different racers, with each
    racer having their own ATV to race with. Each vehicle has its own unique ratings
    in speed, grip, and armor. The player then races against 5 of the other racers
    on 6 different tracks. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the
    more points and cash they earn. The player with the most points after all 6
    races are done wins the championship. Also, after each race, the racer is asked
    questions by another character, where they get to choose their answer from a
    list of responses. For example, an investigative news reporter trying to get a
    scoop on the illegal races, gives the player an interview, which can earn the
    player some extra cash depending on how cooperative they are. Any cash earned
    can then be spent on more weapon ammo for the player's vehicle. Examples of
    weapons included in the game are grenades, land mines and homing missiles.

    In the quiet country of Tradguld, there are many sleepy little towns. Langoud
    rests on the coast, Sharan is the floating city where most of the trade and
    business is done, and Myscatonia is clouded in mystery and wonder. Each city has
    nothing in common with the other except for the fact they share the same
    country. That is until the Dianova sets their sights on them. Dianova is a dark
    evil empire bent on conquering the world through swords and magic.\n
    PLOT:\n
    Meis Triumph lives in the nature-rich town of Kant deep within the countryside
    of Tradguld. He has no worries and lives with his loving family who happens to
    be powerful Spirit Blacksmiths. Then the Dianova brought their war-machine
    crashing down on his quiet life. Everyone was forced to flee in terror and Meis
    became separated from the family he loved. He fled to Boyzby where he vows to
    free his people from the terror and oppression of the Dianovan Empire and where
    he meets the beautiful Sodina. Now the adventure truly begins.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    Thousand Arms by Atlus is an RPG with a faceted story and intricate gameplay. As
    in all RPGs, it has a turn-based combat system but only the character in the
    fist position may attack. The other two members of your party are used for
    defensive back-up.\n
    You play as Meis Triumph, heir to the Triumphs, a family of Spirit Blacksmiths.
    You can add two other members to the war party. You must travel the world and
    talk to people in the cities and towns to get valuable allies and information
    that will aid you on your quest. Stop in the village shops to get new armor,
    weapons and other items to truly make your band of heroes unstoppable.\n
    You also have to go on dates as all great heroes do. Rather than seeking love,
    these dates have another purpose. Keep your date happy and you can get special
    weapons, information and new abilities. So be sure to be a gentleman and always
    pay attention to what must be done in the mini-games to win her over!\n
    As a Spirit Blacksmith you have the ability to make weapons better by increasing
    their attack and defensive power as well as adding new features and spells. Of
    course, along the way you must battle enemies, explore dungeons and perform
    mini-quests in order to achieve your ultimate goal: the destruction of the
    Dianovan Empire and the evil Mecha.\n
    Are you hero enough to save your people? Are you suave enough to be a great
    date? Do you have the emotional and spiritual power to be a truly powerful
    Spirit Blacksmith? Pray you do; your entire race is depending on you.\n
    CHARACTERS:\n
    - Meis Triumph- (16-years-old) The heir to a family of Spirit Blacksmiths, Meis
    learned to be a womanizer from his father. Stubborn and lazy, Meis is forced to
    change his ways against his will, first when the Dark Acolytes force him to
    leave his comfortable home, and then when the spirits of the Ancient Blacksmiths
    give him the mission of finding the sacred flames. He is attracted to Sodina,
    but can't resist hitting on other beautiful women.\n
    In addition to his ability to reforge weapons to increase their power and grant
    them magical spells or special attacks, Meis can obtain "Elemental Beasts" to
    use in combat, similar to the "summons" seen in the Final Fantasy games. His
    weapon is a sword.\n
    - Sodina Dawnfried- (15-years-old) The younger sister of a great Spirit
    Blacksmith named Jyabil, Sodina is a beautiful, red-haired girl; however, she's
    also very brave. After her brother is killed by the Dark Acolytes, she decides
    to help Meis on his quest. She has feelings for Meis but finds herself often
    enraged by his lecherous behaviour. Her weapon of choice is a dagger.\n
    - Muza Grifford- (21-years-old) A knight and an old friend of Meis, he's brave
    but not too clever, and tended to freeze when in the presence of pretty girls.
    He has a very large physique. He develops feelings for Wyna. His weapon is a
    claymore, a huge sword that normal people would have a difficult time
    wielding.\n
    - Wyna Grapple- (17-years-old) The daughter of the King of the Pirates, Wyna is
    a boisterous girl who loves fighting; she joins the party just to go on
    adventures. She wears a bikini as well as an eyepatch, but just for effect,
    she's not missing any eyes. If you pay attention during dates, you'll see that
    Wyna's eyepatch changes eyes from time to time. At first she's attracted to Meis
    because of his strength, but later returns Muza's feelings. Wyna's weapon is a
    large battle hammer.\n
    - Nelsha Stylus- (Appears to be 16-years-old) A unique girl whose personality
    changes when she puts on new outfits, due to the spirits that inhabit them.
    Nelsha is a shy, nerdy-looking girl who speaks of herself in the third person.
    She dreams of becoming a "Dress Master", a title given to the best clothes
    designers in the world (similar to Metalia's title of Jewel Master). Her weapon
    is a magic sewing needle.\n
    In addition, Nelsha can change her costumes in combat, which changes her form
    completely and gives her different powers.\n
    - Kyleen Nelphe- (16-years-old) A green-haired female thief who tries to use the
    party for her own purposes, but ends up befriending and joining them. Her
    personality is cynical and sarcastic. She seems attracted to Soushi. Her weapon
    is a rapier, a sword used for fencing.\n
    - Soushi Maharoba- (18-years-old) A samurai with a lot of pride, who considers
    himself a ladykiller as well. His most notable feature is his pink kimono (a
    garment not usually worn by males). He and Meis can't stand each other at first
    but eventually come to respect each other. His weapon is a katana called
    Masamune (a popular name given to katanas in RPGs, named after the blacksmith
    from feudal Japan).

  game: Valkyrie Profile
  file: Valkyrie Profile (USA) (Disc 1).zip
  developer: Enix
  publisher: Enix
  description:
    In preparation for Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods, Odin has
    commanded Lenneth the Valkyrie to descend to the lower world and gather the
    souls of fallen heroes to serve as soldiers in the approaching conflict. You
    play as Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the
    battlefields of the gods.
    .
    The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions,
    swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful
    for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to
    solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be
    avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle
    system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up
    to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four
    main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right
    timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long
    combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to
    defeat most enemies without them.
    .
    The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using "spiritual concentration" to
    discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes
    that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress
    that come at the end of each "chapter". The chapter system is one of the game's
    most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset
    number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual
    concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies
    with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is
    over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each
    chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to
    improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often
    absent from more traditional console RPGs.

  description:
    Porsche Challenge is the first release from the European division at Sony
    Computer Entertainment. Based on the Porsche Boxster, fans can test drive as
    well as race one of Porsche's most spectacular looking vehicles to date. So
    strap yourself in as you prepare to put the pedal to the metal when you push one
    of the most powerful sport machines to its limits on test tracks set right
    across the globe.\n
    The Porsche Boxster is a machine capable of going from zero to 60 mph in a mere
    6.7 seconds, powered by a six-cylinder, 24-valve twin overhead camshaft. With
    201 horse power at 6,000 rpm and 181 pound-per-foot of torque at 4,500 rpm, the
    Boxster is well known for its amazing power and top speed at 200 km per hour.
    Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has been able to create the 3D model by
    blueprints of the vehicle from Porsche engineers and have created the car all
    the way up from gouraud shading and real-time lighting effects for maximum
    realism and effect. The View Boxster option allows players to watch a
    documentary film on the Porsche's and Boxster's creation with the history told
    from the viewpoint of the engineers themselves.\n
    Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has also created four test grounds for
    testing and racing the Boxster. These include U.S.A., Japan, Alpine, and
    Stuttgart, the official testing track for Porsche vehicles. These tracks have
    been further opened up to create a total of 20 track combinations through the
    use of opening up new paths, and racing the tracks in reverse.\n
    The single-player side of Porsche Challenge is split into Practice, Time Trial,
    and Championship modes. Championship provides a collection of 12 races with five
    other competitors per race, as well as being available through three different
    difficulties. The two-player option allows players to play either Single Race or
    Championship modes with the options to play Arcade or Simulation style where
    they can switch on or off, catch up, and choose one- or two-player delay.
    Players can also select what driver they want to use with each sporting a
    different color Boxster, as well as a racing personality.\n
    Options in Porsche Challenge include a CD player that allows: alignment of the
    four provided electronic tracks with each course (tracks include "Asian Beats,"
    "Alpine Funk," and "Tribute to Dragon"), output effects, change music and sound
    effects volume, high scores, button configuration, and automatic and manual
    selections. English, French, and Italian languages are also offered. As well,
    the game supports analog control and uses only one block of memory.

    WCW vs. the World (known in Japan as Virtual Pro-Wrestling) is a professional
    wrestling video game released in 1997 for the PlayStation video game console. It
    was the first game developed by The Man Breeze (who later became the AKI
    Corporation) to be released outside of Japan and the second wrestling game for
    the PlayStation, following Power Move Pro Wrestling. WCW vs. the World marks the
    first title in the Japanese Virtual Pro-Wrestling series and would be the first
    World Championship Wrestling video game released during its rise amidst the
    Monday Night Wars.\n
    This is one of the original wrestling games for the Sony Playstation. It is the
    second title created, following Power Move Pro Wrestling. The game has a variety
    of characters from all over the world. There are 15 WCW Superstars (superstars
    at the time the game was created, anyway), and 60 wrestlers under aliases in the
    game. These wrestlers are from around the world, many in Japan, some even from
    the WWF. They are not under their real name because THQ did not have the
    copyright to them.\n
    The game itself consists of many modes. You control one wrestler at a time, and
    can take part in any of the following: League Challenge, fight for the belt in a
    league; Best of Seven, select seven opponents and fight for a new belt;
    Exhibition, pick any wrestlers and fight; Elimination, choose five wrestlers
    each, and winner stays on; Tournament, select up to eight wrestlers and battle;
    League, round-robin, winner is wrestler with most points; and Double Title, two
    wrestlers fight, winner wins both belts.\n
    The game features 51 wrestlers. In addition to its WCW/nWo roster, in keeping
    with the game's title, WCW vs. the World also has several "fictional" foreign
    wrestlers. These performers are actually renamed counterparts of real-life
    Japanese wrestlers that could not be properly represented in the game's American
    version due to copyright restrictions. This practice of altering Japanese
    performers for American games would carry on through two more AKI games for the
    Nintendo 64.

    This involves turning them to face certain enemies, issuing orders to attack,
    move (including setting waypoints and patrol loops) or simply hold ground.
    .
    Combat involves charging the enemy, using magical spells (if available) or
    firing long-range weapons, such as arrows or catapults. Of course, line of sight
    and terrain will influence how successful your attacks are, and the emotion
    level (fear, hatred or frenzy) as well as the experience of your troops will

    complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict
    spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every
    mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a
    certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.
    .
    Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers,
    chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of
    which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens,
    you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected
    by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your
    mission.
    .
    Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart
    gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout
    the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and
    seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles

  description:
    Dashing explorer Rick O'Conell has just made a bit of a mistake. In discovering
    the lost City of the Dead, he's awakened an all-powerful evil known as Imhotep,
    a cursed priest who was mummified alive in ancient Egypt and is now, as one
    might imagine, hankering for revenge.\n
    It will take all of Rick's brains and brawn to make it through the coming
    ordeal, as he'll have to survive the Mummy's traps and vile legions if he hopes
    to make it out of the City of the Dead alive. As if that wasn't enough, he'll
    also have to take on the Mummy itself.\n
    Based on the 1999 summer blockbuster starring Brendan Frasier, you take on the
    role of Rick as he swashbuckles his way through this third-person action game,
    running, jumping and mainly fighting his way to the greater depths and secrets
    of the lost city.\n
    Throughout this action-adventure game, players will have to fight off all manner
    of supernatural beasts, from deadly mummies to scarabs, spirits and hordes of
    man-eating bugs. But fighting isn't the only task you'll be forced to encounter,
    as the City of the Dead is laced with all manners of traps and puzzles, each
    waiting for you to make the one mistake that will see you swallowed whole by the
    infinite dust of time.\n
    You won't be going in empty-handed if you take on the hefty task, thankfully, as
    Rick has a veritable arsenal at his disposal, representing many of the guns and
    weapons that were used in the movie, from swords to revolvers, and even to
    magical amulet grenades.\n
    Pure action isn't the only item on The Mummy's menu, however, as you will
    occasionally undertake certain objectives with their own unique viewpoints and
    controls, such as running for your life in a side-scrolling portion. Also
    included on The Mummy is a trailer for its theatrical sequel, The Mummy Returns.

    This Castlevania game was originally released on the Sharp X68000 (a home
    computer relatively unknown outside of Japan) but never made it to the worldwide
    audience. This conversion is meant to fix that, a remake of the original for the
    PlayStation with a good deal of new features.
    .
    This game plays very much like any old platform game on the NES (specifically,
    it plays just like an old Castlevania), you walk slowly forward killing any
    demonic creature you meet. The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or
    walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but
    looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes,
    arranged high quality music and more.

  developer: SouthPeak
  publisher: SouthPeak
  description:
    Thanks to reruns on cable TV's The Nashville Network, The Dukes of Hazzard has
    reached a new audience. Featured as a prime time network series more than a
    decade prior to the release of this Arcade-style racing game, The Dukes of
    Hazzard spawned a ColecoVision cartridge in 1984. Now, with The Dukes of
    Hazzard: Racing for Home, PlayStation owners can get behind the wheel of the
    General Lee and try to foil the mischievous and downright criminal dealings of
    Boss Hogg, the fat blowhard in the white suit, and Rosco P. Coltrane, the inept
    hick sheriff.
    .
    The single-player game consists of nine episodes. Each episode is divided into
    three scenes. Here are just a few of the mission objectives you must complete:
    find and rescue Uncle Jesse and stop his truck; take part in the Hazzard
    Overland Race to try and win mortgage money; find Boss Hogg's car and pull it
    over; and rescue Daisy Duke (the Southern babe in the cutoff shorts) from
    kidnappers. While racing through each mission, you must avoid cop cars, speed
    traps, road obstacles and other hazards.

  developer: Psygnosis
  publisher: Psygnosis
  description:
    Lomax's friends are in trouble, and it's up to you to save them from the
    sinister villain, Evil Ed. Using a magical spell, the fiend has kidnapped them
    and is forcing them to do whatever he instructs. Adventures of Lomax is a
    platform game that presents itself as a Lemmings spin-off (after all, it is
    developed by the same company).
    .
    As the hero, you will have to jump and shoot your way through a multitude of
    side scrolling 2D levels while picking up different power-ups. The special items
    Lomax encounters gain him invincibility; increase the jumping range and power of
    his attacks. Most effects fade off in a specific amount of time and are there to
    give you a quick health boost.
    .
    Adventures of Lomax takes place across several stages (over 40 in all) that
    range from outdoor areas, caves, and dark and spooky castles (four different
    environments). Because this is a platformer, you'll run across obstacles from
    time to time, required to either blast things away, like bats and zombies, or
    jump from platform to platform.

    Australian developer Wildfire Studios changes its focus from big acts like KISS
    and Austin Powers to American history in Patriotic Pinball. Two tables, Road
    Trip Coast to Coast and America on Duty, offer seven missions apiece. In the
    former, missions include rush hour at the Golden Gate Bridge, Muscle Beach,
    Route 66, Las Vegas, New York, gold mines, and whitewater rafting. The second
    table features the destruction of Confederate cannons in the Civil War, boot
    camp, tracking enemy subs, capturing Hill 142, saving the wounded from
    Heartbreak Ridge, flying a B17 bombing run, and helping Uncle Sam.\n
    Patriotic Pinball features four gameplay modes: novice, regular, arcade and
    tournament. In novice mode, the ball saver remains active longer than in regular
    mode (5-ball play with extra balls, end-of-game matching, and a bonus round),
    while arcade mode offers only three balls with extras awarded based on score.
    Tournament mode eliminates the various extras (Wild Fireball, number matching,
    and points) and awards only extra balls as a bonus. Both tables track and save
    high scores to memory card.

    against Draenek in the Arena of Death -- the fifth and final world. There are 24
    tracks in all, spanning apocalyptic city streets and other futuristic settings.
    .
    Before your dangerous journey begins, you'll need to choose one of six different
    characters to play as. Each comes with three varying abilities; the driving
    skill affects a character's handling ability and top speed, tactical affects
    weapon lock-on times and aggression is that character's strength. Among the
    characters is the dangerous Motormouth that thrives on death and annihilation;
    Thula Crimstone, a future leader of the Starian Empire; Jackal, a war-torn being
    that wishes to destroy all those that bring war against his people; and the
    spiritual Hiroki. Throughout the game, they'll earn experience points that

  game: Valkyrie Profile

  developer: Enix
  publisher: Enix
  description:
    In preparation for Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods, Odin has
    commanded Lenneth the Valkyrie to descend to the lower world and gather the
    souls of fallen heroes to serve as soldiers in the approaching conflict. You
    play as Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the
    battlefields of the gods.
    .
    The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions,
    swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful
    for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to
    solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be
    avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle
    system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up
    to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four
    main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right
    timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long
    combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to
    defeat most enemies without them.
    .
    The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using "spiritual concentration" to
    discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes
    that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress
    that come at the end of each "chapter". The chapter system is one of the game's
    most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset
    number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual
    concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies
    with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is
    over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each
    chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to
    improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often
    absent from more traditional console RPGs.

    While a Jet Moto hoverbike might look like a jet ski, it is capable of far more:
    it travels across land as well as water and can use a magnetic grapple to make
    extremely tight turns. During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge
    obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won't hesitate to bump you

    Jet Moto 3 offers ten different riders and 19 tracks across the wide open ocean,
    over mountainous terrain, and through cityscapes. As with the earlier games, two

    character, who battles against the forces of a genetic engineering organization
    gone wrong. Enemies are varied, some deadly powerful, others agile, and
    difficult to hit.\n
    The game is completely 3D-rendered, and it is possible to aim up and down as
    well as left and right. Large, complex levels pose labyrinthine challenges, as
    well as the powerful bosses that wait secured in their deepest chambers. The
    game is set apart from contemporary first-person shooters by a crouch ability,
    which allows the lead character to crawl through ducts and other short spaces.
    The character can also run, strafe, and jump, for full-motion 3D shooter play.\n
    Features:\n
    * Upgrade your gun with mods found throughout each level\n
    * Navigate Tenka through a variety of environments to stop the genetic
    experiments\n

    with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their

    nighttime light show found within the Conga Bowl.\n
    Developed by Adrenaline Entertainment, Ten Pin Alley features twelve different
    characters (both male and female) with varying styles and playing
    characteristics. While some bowl left-handed and concentrate on accuracy, others
    specialize in speed and power. When it's your turn to hurl the ball down the
    lane, a bowling meter appears -- this meter regulates spinning, power and
    releasing techniques. Although putting spin on the ball is optional, you'll need
    to adjust your character's positioning in accordance. Failure to do so may
    result in an embarrassing gutter ball.\n
    There are three different gameplay options including the Open Play, Team Play
    and Tournament modes. Whether perfecting your skills or playing against a number
    of computer-controlled or human opponents, the Open Play is a no-frills single
    game. Team Play involves two or three teams in a heated bowling match-up. Teams
    may consist of both AI characters and/or human players. Whenever you're ready to
    take on fierce competition, sign yourself up for the TPA Tour! Featuring a field
    of 64 players, the Tournament incorporates knockout styled gameplay until a
    champion is crowned. There are two specific Tournament styles including the
    Amateur or Professional modes. Whereas the former features tougher opposition
    and bigger prizes, the Amateur mode is suited for novice players.\n
    Ten Pin Alley features the ability to create your own personal bowler and
    customize the weapon of choice -- your bowling ball. There's also a statistical
    tracker that records your personal data, everything from strikes to how much
    money you've made in professional tournaments. For novice players, the
    instruction manual outlines the scoring methodology of how many points are
    awarded after obtaining a strike or a spare. It supports any PlayStation Memory
    Card for saving game data and the Multi Tap for six human players.

    In Defcon 5, space aliens attack colony MRP-6F and turn a once peaceful evening
    of engineering into a battle for survival.
    .
    In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are
    being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an cyberneer
    engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code,
    the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You
    must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.
    .
    The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams
    connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You
    must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and
    scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.

    Disney's animated film TARZAN gets the videogame treatment and makes his way to
    the PlayStation. The game follows the plot of the movie: you must help Tarzan
    grow from a boy to an adult in the span of 14 levels of action. While many of
    the levels offer platform-jumping, vine-swinging fun, some of them recreate some
    of the action sequences from the movie. No matter where he is, Tarzan must
    collect the tokens and fruit that are scattered about. Collecting 100 tokens
    earns an extra life, and the fruit can be used to dispose of enemies. If you can
    collect the four pieces of Jane's baboon drawing, you can earn the chance to
    play a bonus level. You've got to help the young ape-man discover his place in
    the world with TARZAN.

  description:
    Freestyle Motocross: McGrath vs. Pastrana not only combines two of the sport's
    biggest stars, but also the two unique styles of motocross into one game. The
    game seeks to combine both freestyle and motocross into one event.\n
    Players race amongst four other riders, taking on a twisted track with plenty of
    places to catch air, but they won't just be jockeying for the head of the pack.
    They'll also have to mix some tricks into their run, because position is not
    only determined by where you are in the pack, but how stylish and challenging
    your run is in terms of stunts. There are over 30 tricks in all to keep you
    occupied.\n
    There are ten different tracks for you to challenge in Freestyle Motocross,
    ranging from predictable locations such as Las Vegas to more exotic locales like
    Tombstone and Loch Ness. Each track is built to suit both speed and tricks,
    alternating between straight-aways and bumpy terrain perfect for executing a
    combo or holding that trick for just a moment longer in order to score bigger
    points.\n
    Of course, if the racing aspect of the game isn't your cup of tea, you can also
    switch to a plain Freestyle mode where the only goal is to do tricks and score
    points - perfect for those who like to cut out everything but the basics. You
    can also choose to play a Single Race or run some Time Trials. And if you get
    tired of playing by yourself, grab a friend and go head to head in Multiplayer
    mode.\n
    Features:\n
    # Racing mode\n
    # Freestyle mode\n

    It starts as a simple assignment for the three mercenaries - the beautiful,

    Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars
    and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young
    Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners
    don't suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very

    dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they'll have to confront
    Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan...
    .
    The gameplay of "Fear Effect" is based on survival horror titles à la  Resident

    When Rise of the Robots was released for the Super Nintendo in 1994, it didn't

    sounds were but a thin veil over a clunky, slow, and exceedingly dull game. Rise
    2 Resurrection for the Sony PlayStation, the sequel to Rise of the Robots,
    improves upon the original game's positive aspects and fixes some of its
    problems.\n
    Once again the music is written and performed by former Queen band member Brian
    May, and once again it rocks hard, this time with the benefit of CD technology.
    The graphics are an improvement over its handsome predecessor, and the sound
    effects are vibrant and explosive. While these aesthetic improvements are to be
    expected, the things that are the same in Rise 2 Resurrection from the first
    Rise of the Robots is the gameplay.\n
    There are 18 different darkly futuristic fighters, a slew of combos, several
    gruesome termination moves, and plenty of combat techniques. It's certainly not
    very original, but it is fun. The controls are responsive, and the fights are
    furious and thoroughly convincing. When you pull off a multiple-hit combo and
    robotic metal clangs against robotic metal, it's enough to make your teeth

    In the world of the dead you can't use normal weapons, your gun shoots ghosts
    which kill the zombies and the other ugly creatures which live there. You also
    have different voodoo powers and weapons. And you're carrying a large inventory
    around.

  developer: JVC

  description:
    Vampire Hunter D for the PlayStation is based on the anime titled Vampire Hunter
    D: Bloodlust.  That anime is based on the novel title Vampire Hunter D: Demon
    Deathchase written by Hideyuki Kikuchi.  You play as D, the half-human /
    half-vampire whose sole mission in life is to hunt down and kill vampires.  The
    setting is not the distant medieval past, nor is it the mid-19th century,
    instead D's adventures are set in the far distant future, when humanity has
    nearly killed itself off by endless wars.  Rising from the scorched earth and
    assuming power in this desolate era are the timeless vampires.  They established
    a feudal system where they ruled over humans as nobles in Europe ruled over
    their peasants.  But after thousands of years the Vampires' power waned and
    humans revolted against their lords, and thus the class of Vampire Hunters were
    born.
    .
    In this particular story, D is employed by a rich family to retrieve their
    daughter from the vampire who kidnapped her.  He is not the only one trying to
    free her; a rival group of vampire hunters, the Marcus Brothers, are after the
    daughter and the bounty, regarding D as a rival.  The Vampire Hunter D must
    enter Castle Chaith, battle the Vampire Lord, the minions that inhabit the
    castle, and a hidden evil, to save the girl and collect his bounty.
    .
    The action in Vampire Hunter D plays like the early Resident Evil games for the
    PlayStation.  There are pre-rendered backgrounds and all the characters are
    animated in 3D.  Players utilize D's signature weapon, his massive long sword,
    as well as his special vampire powers, (which comprise healing, offensive, and
    defensive powers), to battle the hordes of evil creatures that live in the
    hallways and chambers of the daemonic Castle Chaith.  You must solve puzzles,
    unlock doors, and retrieve key items to progress into the depths and heights of
    the castle, ultimately reaching and revealing the true evil power pulling the
    strings of this macabre story.

    NBA ShootOut 2003 offers three separate game modes: Exhibition, Season, and

    season, gamers can make trades, check stats, and find out about league news. In
    Playoff mode, gamers go directly to the NBA Playoffs, where they can customize
    which 16 teams will compete for the NBA Finals. For special features, NBA
    ShootOut 2003 once again allows gamers to create their own NBA superstar with
    the Create Player feature. Additionally, in the Create Dunk mode, gamers can

  description:
    It's time to experience the mishaps and adventures of Tom and Jerry's bitter
    rivalry. Tom and Jerry in House Trap is a split screen action adventure for one
    or two players. Fight your way through the pages of Jerry's new book "My Life
    With Tom" and follow them through all the rooms in the house finding ways to
    knock the other out.\n
    As defiant mouse Jerry, single-players move about the house setting traps for
    Tom the cat. As Jerry continues to set traps in one half of the split screen,
    players can watch the results in the other half of the screen as Tom falls
    victim to (or outsmarts) the traps that have already been set. If Jerry notices
    that Tom seems to be getting a little too close for comfort, he can also blow
    his dog whistle and Spike will come to chase after Tom and even the odds a
    bit.\n
    When two people play at once, one can take on the role of Tom and help him to
    avoid the traps that Jerry sets. The game features 15 different rooms to
    explore, each with its own challenges and rewards, and each successive level
    unlocks a new room in the house with more weapons scattered throughout. While
    most of the challenges involve reducing the other player's health first, some
    levels require rubber duckies be collected and placed in a pond. The first
    player to collect the required amount wins the match.\n
    Both Tom and Jerry have limited health that is represented by a green status
    bar, and can be drained by hitting them with umbrellas, cooking pans, ladles,
    and hammers (to name a few). Some objects, such as cakes, anvils and bottles can
    be thrown at the other character, while others like bombs and Jell-o molds can
    be dropped in their path.\n
    Help Jerry prove that cats aren't as smart as they look, or make Tom the envy of
    all the local cats by bringing Jerry in.

    Sanvein is a fast-paced top down shooter where time is of the essence and every
    moment counts. The main computer of the self-sufficient space colony Utopia,
    called St. Schutz, has gone haywire. The goal of the game is to escape from
    Utopia.\n
    The game plays very differently from a normal space shooter. Each "floor" is
    made up of a series of interconnected rooms, and the player can choose any room
    adjacent to one they've cleared. For each adjacent room the player has cleared,
    their firepower in that room will be greater. Each floor has a number of boss
    rooms with a much larger and more dangerous enemy, each of which must be cleared
    to complete the floor. There is also a stronger power weapon which will recharge
    after use.\n
    All the while, a strict timer is counting down. When the player gets hit,
    instead of dying or taking damage, they lose time on the timer. The only way to
    get more time is to defeat a boss, so the player must balance between clearing
    rooms for greater firepower, and clearing bosses for more time.\n
    The game has a unique glitch-futuristic art style and five floors to play
    through. There are three ships and three weaponry systems to choose from.

    Taking a cue from the company's other futuristic racer Wipeout, Rollcage

    the track. Players can drive their vehicle on tunnel ceilings, up on massive

  description:
    In a future world, an army of steel robots are out to destroy the human race.
    Our only hope is a little yellow tank armed with some mighty big guns. The
    sentient Tiny Tank was originally created to appease a public that feared the
    mindless violence waged by larger war-robots, but he was soon destroyed by one
    of those jealous automatons at the beginning of the robot revolution 100 years
    ago. Almost destroyed, at least.\n
    Thanks to nano-technology, hundreds of microscopic "Fix-It Crabs" went to work
    and Tiny Tank was slowly rebuilt. Now he alone stands against the threat of the
    cruel MuTank and his deadly robot minions, who have all but erased human
    civilization from the planet's surface. The spunky little tank will need luck,
    strategy, and all the futuristic firepower he can get his treads on to save the
    human race.\n
    STORY:\n
    Sometime before 2094 A.D., all of Earth's armed forces were disintegrated into
    one large corporation, SenTrax. SenTrax vowed to create a robot army to fight
    humanity's wars, so mankind itself would not have to. However, they needed the
    peoples' vote to set this plan into motion, and thus developed the titular "Tiny
    Tank" - a small yellow tank with an occasionally unfriendly attitude. The
    creation of this cute killing machine made SenTrax's popularity skyrocket, and
    won them the vote. As thanks, the corporation set up an exhibition showing their
    yellow mascot fighting off the entire SenTrax army on July 4, 2094, broadcast
    live over the Internet. However, once the event began, one of the SenTrax robots
    had been accidentally fitted with live ammunition and destroyed Tiny with one
    shot. As a result, Tiny's "positronic brain" (his artificial intelligence
    system) shattered, and its shards gave "life" to the entire robot army. The
    robot that had fired the shot, now self-aware and calling himself Mutank, took
    control of the rampant robots and began to eliminate humanity so that machines
    could thrive. Humanity was forced to evacuate into underground asteroid shelters
    as the mechanical army conquered the surface.\n
    On July 4, 2194 A.D., exactly 100 years later, Tiny Tank was finally rebuilt
    thanks to automated SenTrax Fix-It Crabs, which were minuscule robots made to
    repair broken machinery. A female artificial intelligence on board an orbital
    satellite reawakened Tiny, and sent him to fight Mutank's robot army and save
    mankind.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    Tiny Tank is a relatively straightforward third person shooter. The player
    controls Tiny as he traverses many levels, eliminating SenTrax forces as he
    goes. There are two bars at the top of the screen that show Tiny's health and
    the amount of nanometal acquired. Nanometal is essential for the on-board Fix-It
    Crabs to repair Tiny. If the nanometal meter runs out, health cannot be
    regenerated. There is also a map on the upper right hand corner identifying the
    surroundings, enemies, and mission objectives.Tiny canalso pick up fallen parts
    from destroyed enemie.\n

  developer: Ubisoft

  description:
    Doukyu Billiard Master (known as Pool Hustler outside Japan): You're a hustler,
    baby. Weaseling your way from underground pool halls to even seedier settings,
    the objective is to play the best game of pool possible while wagering high
    amounts of cash. But no matter how good you think you are, there's always
    someone better than you...or is there? Pool Hustler will give you the
    opportunity to find out!
    .
    Pool Hustler features several gameplay options including the Lesson, Story,
    Two-Player, Practice, and Trick Shot modes. Outlined somewhat in the first
    paragraph, the Story mode features a city map with six different pool halls.
    Players will go around to the various halls, make wagers, and try to beat one of
    12 different pool champions. Just be careful not to bite off more you can chew
    -- you'll be left with an empty wallet and the game will be over.\n
    Your opponents range from hustler wannabes to actual pool sharks; the short
    tempered Joseph acts as a stepping stone for victory while Morgan learned to
    play a mean game of pool during a 35-year prison sentence. Each player has his
    or her own unique style and grasp on the fundamentals of pool theory, so watch
    yourself!\n
    The Lesson and Practice modes are great for new players; while the former
    teaches players the mechanics of pool via tutorial sequences, the Practice mode
    is there for practicing trick shots and angles. It even allows you to place
    balls on a table in any manor you desire! When you've got the necessary skills
    to take on your pool shark friends, challenge them to a Two-Player duel! Players
    can select between four different games including Nine Ball, Eight Ball,
    Rotation, and 14.1 Continuous. Finally, the Trick Shot mode features 30 unique
    trick shots for the player to master!\n
    Players are required to play in accordance to strict, but realistic rulings. For
    example, if you sink the cue ball or fail to hit the lowest numbered ball in
    Nine Ball, you'll be fouled. If you're playing by professional rules only, three
    fouls result in automatic disqualification. Additionally, general rules are
    followed such as lagging for break, calling shots, and break options.\n
    So get out there and show them who's the real Pool Hustler!

  description:
    A long time ago, in a distant galaxy, an alien race was fighting for survival.
    Over thousands of years, their society had expanded until their home planet
    could no longer support the population. The only way to continue their
    civilization was to look to the stars. For many years the aliens searched for
    another planet that could support life, and just when they were about to give up
    hope, they discovered a small, green and blue planet in a distant galaxy - it
    was perfect, almost too good to be true.\n
    A plan of action was devised and swiftly executed. First they sent some breeding
    pods, these pods were designed to land on the planet and break open, scattering
    hundreds of aliens over the area. They would then start to colonize the planet
    in readiness for the main body of aliens, which would travel at a much slower
    pace in a gigantic spacecraft.\n
    These pods landed in a remote part of Siberia and their passengers began to
    multiply. It was however, not as remote as the bugs had hoped and they found
    themselves close to a human military base. The bugs waited underground until
    they were strong and had multiplied sufficiently to take on the humans.\n
    When the time was right, the decision was made and the bugs attacked the base -
    to make ready for the arrival of the main hive. They had to move quickly to
    spread to other parts of Earth.\n
    The military quickly mobilized against the 'bug' threat, but their conventional
    forces proved to be useless. Overpowered by the toxins emitted by the new enemy,
    there was only one thing left, a secret, experimental battle suit, originally
    developed for use by ground forces in nuclear conflict - it's untested, but it's
    the only chance. They just need someone brave enough to give it a shot...\n
    The Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M. missions may be played by one or two players.
    There are also four multiplayer modes: Deathmatch, Racewars, Capture the Flag,
    and King of the Hill.

    Three weeks after the Eurasia space colony incident, the Earth's surface was

    Reploids were sent in to terraform the land in an attempt to make the planet
    habitable for humans once more, however, a Reploid and former colleague of Alia
    named Gate discovered something unusual amidst the ruins of Earth — a piece of
    Zero's DNA. After examining Zero's DNA, Gate became mad with power and an
    outbreak of bizarre Mavericks occurred. Weeks passed, Isoc, a Reploid scientist
    and an associate of Gate, announced to the people that a new phenomenon known as
    "Nightmare" has quickly spread throughout the world, causing Reploids to
    hallucinate and eventually destroy themselves. Isoc suspects the cause of the
    outbreak is none other than Zero who been spreading the phenomenon as he goes,
    much to X's anger and confusion. Isoc rallies Reploids throughout the world to
    aid the Nightmare Investigators, led by the powerful High-Max, at key locations
    to track down the source of this new phenomenon as well as Zero. X, along with
    the Maverick Hunters, must confront the Nightmare Investigators as they try to
    solve the mystery behind the Nightmare Phenomenon and clear Zero's name.

  description:
    In the near future, mankind's tinkering with the science of genetics and the
    developmental process of genome mapping has resulted in the accidental creation
    of a new disease known as EINDS. This disease, which attacks a cell's DNA and
    halts mitosis and meiosis (the processes that allow our cells to duplicate), has
    killed nearly a billion people and no hope of a cure has been discovered.\n
    With the disease spreading rapidly, it is feared that the manipulations of DNA
    will lead to mankind's complete undoing. It's up to three mercenaries and a
    mysterious woman with no past to combine their separate efforts into one
    adventure involving danger, intrigue, and supernatural involvement, with the
    prize perhaps being salvation for human kind.\n
    Fear Effect: Retro Helix is a cinematic adventure game for the PlayStation.
    Although it has been released after the original Fear Effect title, it is in
    actuality a prequel to the events in the first game, explaining how Hana
    Tsu-Vachel, Royce Glas, and Jacob Decourt wound up together. The game takes
    place over four levels, each of which has its own CD: futuristic, gritty Hong
    Kong, the Walled City of Xi'an, the Tomb of the First Emperor of China, and the
    legendary Penglai Shan, mountain home to the immortals.

    As another addition to the off-road racing genre, TNN Motorsports HardCore TR
    features over 30 unique courses and 24 souped-up hotrods and all-terrain trucks
    customizable to your own preferences. Tracks span various locations throughout
    the United States ranging from the deserts and dirt trails of Arizona and the
    muddy swamps of Florida to the familiar wine valley landmarks of Northern
    California and the deep canyons of New Mexico.\n
    Held together by a map outlining race locations, the gameplay options include an
    Arcade, Championship, Player, Time Trial and Test Track modes. After making
    various modifications to your truck, you'll want to select the Test Track in
    order to see whether or not those changes positively or negatively affected your
    vehicle. Once your truck's handling and feel is to your liking, its time for
    some competition!\n
    The Championship mode spans four hardcore divisions beginning in the 4x4 Amateur
    Class; as you improve your driving skills, you'll move onto the Hotrod Amateur,
    4x4 Pro and Hotrod Pro classes. Whereas the amateur classes (only readily
    available seasons upon startup) are five races long, the professional brackets
    span 10 different tracks. Your objective is to finish each division with the
    most points. Points are awarded by finishing in a top position: first place
    awards 10 points; second gives you six; and third hands out four. If you're
    successful in the amateur seasons, you'll be placed into the professional season
    where the competition is much tougher.\n
    If you'd rather not deal with points and qualifying, the Arcade mode allows you
    to immediately jump into the action. You'll start in a designated location and
    unlock different locations by finishing in first place. By doing well in all the
    Arcade races, you'll not only unlock the various tracks but also bonus trucks
    available for your choosing. The Time Trial has you in a heated competition
    against the clock for the ultimate lap times.\n
    TNN Motorsports Hardcore TR also features a multi-player Player mode that pits
    you and another human opponent in a split-screen battle. The game supports
    analog control for unprecedented handling, the vibration function and a memory
    card for saving game data and modifications. There are also weather effects such
    as rain, snow and foggy conditions.\n

    Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars
    and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young
    Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners
    don't suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very
    dangerous areas of Hong-Kong, but to outskirt villages infected by zombies, a
    dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they'll have to confront
    Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan...
    .
    The gameplay of "Fear Effect" is based on survival horror titles à la  Resident
    Evil, but it also features many pure action elements and arcade-like sequences,
    where precise timing matters. You can crouch, sneak on your enemies, and roll
    forward or to the sides. There are many human as well as monster enemies to
    eliminate or to avoid. The game's characters are created in animé style,
    although they appear in full 3D. The backgrounds are pre-rendered, but very
    intensely animated, similar to those of  Blade Runner. The story unfolds through

    The original Tecmo Bowl was an instant hit on the Nintendo Entertainment System.
    The game combined simple, easy to grasp arcade action, insanely catchy music and
    real NFL players. Tecmo's sequel in 1991, Tecmo Super Bowl, added the NFL
    license and detailed statistical tracking for an entire season. It was
    considered by many as the best football game released for the 8-bit system. The
    series would continue into the 16-bit market, with three games released on both
    the SNES and Genesis (Tecmo Super Bowl, Tecmo Super Bowl II and Tecmo Super Bowl
    III). While it would face heavy competition from the Maddens and Montanas, the
    game still maintained a strong loyal following--a testament to its universal
    appeal.\n
    Tecmo Super Bowl marks its first appearance on the Playstation after success in
    the both the 8-bit and 16-bit console markets. While the name hasn't changed,
    the game has undergone several refinements--perhaps none more dramatic than the
    ability to change the field's perspective. Instead of a horizontal view, you can
    now adjust the camera to a vertical or diagonal position. Instant replay, a
    tournament mode, expanded playbooks and live commentary have also been added to
    the game, to bring it up to speed with similar PlayStation sports offerings.\n
    The hallmarks of the Tecmo series have been left unchanged: you still get both
    the NFL and NFLPA licenses, variable weather conditions, stat tracking,
    injuries, multiple schedules and an emphasis on arcade action. Don't like how
    your team is performing? Feel free to edit players' names, abilities or trade
    them away! Just make sure you save enough room on your memory card--a hefty
    eleven blocks is needed to save your data.

    Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends was an animated program, that
    originally aired in 1999 as part of BKN, the syndicated's cartoon programing
    block. The programming segment premiered in 1992. The show was part of BKN's
    drive to reinvent itself. The show's premise was that aliens had been living
    among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know
    from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves.
    .
    On the show, the Roswell UFO Incident which is part of a conspiracy theory (that
    many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made
    phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth.
    The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey
    man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force
    investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing
    but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there
    were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the
    human race.

    Circuit Breakers is a racing game similar to Micro Machines and Ignition, where
    the vehicles resemble toys viewed from above. The game lets the player control
    cars (of various models), boats and submarines that change according to the
    track.
    .
    The tracks have power-ups. They can be collected and activated and have negative
    and positive effects. Most are standard power-ups from this type of game, like
    speed boosts and oil leaks. Some are more bizarre, making the vehicle bigger or
    smaller, or making it bounce or fly.
    .
    The tracks are organized by theme and difficulty. By winning races the player
    receives access to increasingly more challenging tracks. The game controls are
    particularly sensitive, and getting out of the path often makes the vehicle
    explode.
    .
    Instead of a fixed camera, the game usually changes angles when the vehicle
    reaches certain points of the track. The camera can go as low as behind the
    vehicle, and go high to a "bird's eye" viewpoint.
    .
    Multi-player mode has its own set of tracks. It supports up to 4 players (using
    a multi-tap).

    real-time 3D graphics and support for up to four players. As with the two
    previous CD-ROM games, Scrabble for the PlayStation even contains the Merriam
    Webster's Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary, 3rd Edition, so players can
    look up definitions to certain words (not all are available, however) and
    determine if a word actually exists.
    .
    For those unfamiliar with the board game from which this title is based,
    Scrabble involves forming words using wooden tiles representing individual
    letters. These tiles are then placed into rows on a board made up of 225 spaces.
    Each letter is worth a certain point value, and some of the spaces will offer
    specific bonuses if you manage to build off them. The player with the most
    points after all the tiles have been placed on the board is considered the
    winner. The PlayStation version follows this same format, but with automatic
    scoring and a computer opponent named Maven with eight selectable difficulty
    levels.

    graphics. The player moves the character around using the mouse, examines the
    environment, talks to other people and collects items stored in an inventory.
    These items need to be used or combined with other items to solve puzzles.

    objective being to totally dominate your opponent with bone-crunching blows and
    crushing moves, then pin him to the mat and be declared victor. This may seem a
    fairly simple concept, but when you add the variety of moves and each wrestler's
    unique styles -- this definitely becomes a game of skill and strategy.\n

    specifically tailored to each wrestler's personalities. Wrestlers include Bret
    Hart, Shawn Michaels, Vader, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Ultimate Warrior, Owen

    player to hit different buttons in time with the music. While it can be played
    with a regular PlayStation controller, the game also supports a special "dancing
    pad" that allows players to move their feet to the beat instead of just pressing

    Introducing Lammy, a totally rockin' guitarist.  In day-to-day life, she's quite
    timid, shy, and wimpy - but put a guitar in her hands, and she'll blow you away!
    Help Lammy get to her latest gig on time, and face obstacles such as flaming
    buildings, out-of-control airplanes, and even getting trapped in Hell.
    .
    In this sequel to PaRappa The Rapper you play as Lammy, a guitarist for MilkCan
    - the coolest, hippest band ever!  While PaRappa focused on lyrics, with each
    button controlling a different word; Lammy is a guitar player, so naturally,
    each button controls a different note on the guitar.  Lammy will encounter seven
    different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons
    accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe.
    The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better
    performance.
    .
    Lammy improves over PaRappa in a multitude of ways.  Rather than just being a
    single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend.  Any stages
    that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively.  If you
    don't have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer
    to take on the role of your partner.  After finishing the initial game, PaRappa
    also makes a return, allowing you to play through the game again with raps
    instead of Lammy's guitar.

    Rayman Rush is a character-based racing game similar to other foot-racing titles
    such as Micro Maniacs or the Xbox' Mad Dash Racing. A selection of seven
    playable characters from the Rayman universe race to the finish line, overcoming
    obstacles and collecting power-ups along the way.\n
    Rayman Rush is a on-foot racing game developed and published by Ubisoft, based
    on the Rayman universe. In many ways, it is like half of a port of Rayman Arena,
    featuring conversions of the same race tracks, the same introduction movie and
    also character theme songs (it, however, lacks the battles from M, and the
    character roster is different). It is a 1-2 player game, and each race has 2
    characters running (1 in certain game modes). The game was released 4 months
    after Rayman M/Arena.\n
    Races take place on 12 tracks in four worlds and there are five main modes of
    play: Training, Championship, Time Attack, Lum, and Target. Some of the modes of
    play in Rayman Rush concern more combative contests, as opposed to
    straightforward racing. Success allows players to unlock new characters and play
    modes. Two Rayman Rush players can race head-to-head, split-screen style.

    can play at once) is given $10,000 to start, with the goal being to earn as much
    money for "retirement" as possible.\n
    You'll first have to choose between college or starting a career, and subsequent
    turns involve spinning a wheel, moving your car token along the board, following
    directions on the space, and making decisions to maximize your earnings. The
    PlayStation version offers a 3D game board and your choice of car tokens and

    Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up

    a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than

  description:
    World Championship Wrestling, Inc. (WCW) was an American professional wrestling
    promotion which existed from 1988 to 2001.\n
    WCW Backstage Assault is a professional wrestling video game by Electronic Arts.
    It was the final World Championship Wrestling (WCW) game released before the
    company was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n
    WCW Backstage Assault takes over 50 WCW wrestlers out of the ring and into
    real-world venues like a locker room, garage and a loading dock. Traditional
    wrestling moves can be used, but weapons like two-by-fours and trash cans are
    also thrown into the mix. By working your way through the game's various modes,
    you can unlock additional wrestlers, areas and weapons. Bobby Heenan and Tony
    Schiavone provide the commentary with over 8,000 lines of dialogue.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    Backstage Assault is vastly different from other games of its genre. Any
    wrestling game prior to it that featured backstage areas (such as the SmackDown!
    series or its predecessor, WCW Mayhem) treated them as auxiliary fighting
    locations. Backstage Assault took the concept further by removing the ring
    entirely and having all action take place backstage.\n
    Hardcore Challenge is Backstage Assault's primary gameplay mode. It consists of
    winning matches against random opponents until challenged by the champion.\n
    Throughout the game, players can unlock wrestlers, arenas, and moves for use in
    Create-a-Superstar. The player cannot defend the championship after earning
    it.\n
    Features:\n
    Choose from more than 50 WCW stars in an assortment of match types\n
    Fight in a total of 14 backstage areas, including a semi-trailer lot\n

  developer: Natsume

  description:
    While the old adage that "turnabout is fair play" applies in many situations,
    Natsume's Turnabout is all about diabolical puzzles where players rotate the
    entire puzzle while the pieces move within its borders, sliding and rolling into
    mind-numbing configurations and patterns. The 100 puzzles provided are divided
    into two groups of 50: Begin Mode and Main Mode. The first 50 puzzles must be
    solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in
    five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row
    of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially.\n
    Puzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks,
    and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks
    adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the
    puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen "steps,"
    even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the
    flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the
    100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape. For players looking for even
    more challenges, up to 50 custom-made puzzles can be devised, using five
    different colored balls and blocks and nine movable sliders (blocks) in Edit
    Mode.\n
    Features:\n
    * One hundred puzzles with moving balls and sliding blocks\n
    * Create up to 50 additional custom puzzles in edit mode\n

    players to hit the slopes free of score or trick requirements to simply enjoy
    the thrill of snowboarding. In Tour Challenge, an around-the-world jaunt, there
    are a number of different requirements for passing levels. There are five
    different tours to choose from and 12 different events to take on. Beating
    different levels will release them for use in Free Ride.\n
    If you're the type that eschews variety for specialization, then the Specialist
    mode is for you. In this mode, players can take on specific types of challenges,
    ranging from Big Air to Slopestyle to Half-pipe, shredding through 12 courses to
    unlock more levels. Stunt Mode rounds out the different ways to play Pure Ride,
    and in it players must complete 18 stages, hitting a variety of tricks to
    progress.\n
    There is also a two-player feature that allows multiple snowboarders to take
    each other on in a myriad of events. And if you enjoy making your own levels,
    prepare to rejoice, for Pure Ride allows you to construct your own slopes,
    making them as tame or insane as you like.

    Saiyuki: Journey West is a tactical role-playing video game. It is based loosely
    on the Chinese novel Journey to the West.\n
    It follows the basic outline of the plot of the novel, in which the main
    character, a Buddhist practitioner named Sanzo, travels from China to India on a
    religious mission and has a variety of adventures along the way. The game also
    features several other characters from the novel, including Son Goku, the monkey
    king. In contrast to other renditions of the story, the game allows Sanzo to be
    played as either a male or a female character at the player's choice.

    16, May 1886\n
    There will be many stories concerning the events that took place in 1886 or as
    most have come to call it, the Autumn of Death. They have all been dismissed as
    mere hallucinations, the prattling of drunks or some stage of a sickness. I know
    better. I was there.\n
    That night the dead rose from the graves, demons stalked the Great Museum and
    even mummies walked among the living. Everyone saw a skeletal knight vanquishing
    all the horrid beasts. I spoke to him. I even aided him in his quest to destroy
    Lord Palethorn of Shoreditch. It's all true. Every word of it! Below is what I
    was able to uncover about our knight in placid bone. Read closely and heed my
    words.\n
    I found an old legend about a mighty knight, whose name I now know to be Sir
    Daniel Fortesque, that starts around the 13th century. He was a mighty warrior
    from the land of Gallowmere, now too a legend. He was slain in battle against
    the insane wizard, Zarok. Unfortunately, Sir Dan's death was for nothing. Zarok
    lived on and soon came into possession of a book of dark magic.\n
    Several years passed before Zarok finally deciphered the spell he was looking
    for. It is written that with this book of dark magic, Zarok awoke the dead to
    use them in an army. He was delighted and mad with power, so mad that he never
    realized that the spell worked all too well.\n
    As the legend goes, Sir Dan arose from his eternal sleep and took up the task he
    died trying to complete. After defeating all the roving minions of the damned
    and dead, he finally met Zarok face to face. It was an epic battle of might and
    magic but in the end, Sir Dan completed his knightly quest started several years
    before. With Zarok dead, Sir Dan hid the magic book and returned to his eternal
    rest.\n
    Now, some 500 years later, I witnessed Sir Dan awaken again. This time it was by
    the megalomaniac Lord Palethorn of Shoreditch. He was a man from the wrong side
    of the rails. He even bought a title to make himself feel more important.
    However, the society elite never really excepted him. That is when he turned to
    the book of dark magic and cast a spell to raise the dead. He wanted to destroy
    all of England and become its sole ruler.\n
    At first sight of Sir Dan I was sick to my stomach. One eye, no skin, he was
    hideous and a bit angry. I felt badly for Sir Dan, but I was extremely excited
    by the prospect of having him on my side. Being an older gentleman, I was not
    fit enough to do battle. My expertise is in the sciences and I know a bit of
    magic.\n
    Once this was all over, I bade Sir Dan farewell. I pray I never get to see him
    again in my lifetime. I pray that my ancestors will never have to see him in
    theirs. I knew they would deny it all. I can only pray that who so ever finds
    this believes me. I know not where Sir Dan placed the accursed book and that is
    probably for the best. I only hope its evil is gone for good. Believe in
    monsters, it may save us all some day.\n
    -- From the Private Diaries of Professor Hamilton Kift\n
    In Medievil II by Sony, you once again you play as Sir Dan. This time, instead
    of facing a mad sorcerer from your day, you must take on the modern world,
    modern 19th century that is. Using all the weapons at your disposal, you must
    help Professor Hamilton as he tries to figure out how to undo the damage being
    done by Lord Palethorn.\n
    Along the way, you will meet a helper ghost named Winston. He was raised by the
    kindly Professor and will give you tips from time to time. You must also collect
    treasure, keys and books to help in your quest. You'll need to buy certain items
    and ammo as well as read up on the enemy.\n
    There are, of course, the standard medieval weaponry like the sword, hammer and
    axe, along with different sizes of shields. There is also one modern weapon, the
    gatling gun. Along with the weapons you find, be sure to vanquish all your
    enemies and get the Chalice of Souls. Bringing this cup back to the Professor
    will prove to be very beneficial to Sir Dan.\n
    You also get to do things only the dead can do. Like putting your head on some
    of the creepy free-roaming hands that are moving about the Great Museum. Why
    would you want to do that? Why, to do some recon and get into those hard to
    reach places of course. Without revealing too much, your head will be placed on
    another body by the good Professor so you can stand a "fighting" chance against
    a certain enemy.

    Adventure mode and a special Head-To-Head contest. Those of you who misspent
    your youths in the Arcades will recall that the original Q*bert stars a little
    round orange guy with bulging eyes, a round snout for a nose, short legs and no
    arms or torso. Your job is to hop Q*bert around a pyramid of cubes and change
    the colors of the cubes to a target color. In later rounds, you will need to
    change the colors of the cubes more than once in order to achieve your goal.
    Once the entire pyramid has been changed to the target color, you advance to a
    new pyramid.\n
    While you are hopping Q*bert up and down the cubes of each pyramid, enemies,
    most of which are deadly to the touch, will try and stop your progress. Another
    way to die is to hop off of the pyramid without landing on one of the three
    discs that are placed above and beside the pyramid. These discs are useful when
    enemies, such as Coily the snake (Q*bert's archenemy), are in hot pursuit. Green
    enemies and objects can (and should be) be touched, and some of them cause
    trouble. For example, Slick and Sam wreak havoc by hopping on cubes and changing
    their color.

    There are three different play modes in NFL Blitz. In "Arcade" mode, your

    As in the classic arcade title Breakout, Sorcerer's Maze presents players with a

    destroying a variety of colored bricks found within. Players are equipped with a
    small paddle, capable only of horizontal movement, which they maneuver so as to
    deflect a tiny ball around the screen -- the ball will destroy any brick it
    contacts, while continuing to ricochet.\n
    Failing to keep the ball in play will result in the loss of a life -- lose three
    and the game is over. Destroying certain bricks will result in power-ups being
    dropped into play, which will alter such variables as the size of the paddle and
    the number of balls onscreen at any one time, to name but two. Power-ups can
    also be purchased between stages in order to better equip oneself for precarious
    situations that may lie ahead.\n
    The game comprises more than 100 stages in all, with every ten stages grouped
    into a "world" based upon a specific theme. At the conclusion of each world,
    players will face off against a boss creature that must be dispatched in order
    to continue. Sorcerer's Maze supports both two-player cooperative and
    competitive play, the former allowing two players to assist each other in

  game: Mortal Kombat Mythologies : Sub-Zero
  file: Mortal Kombat Mythologies - Sub-Zero (USA).zip
  developer: Acclaim
  publisher: Acclaim
  description:
    Midway decided to do something a little different with its Mortal Kombat
    franchise. They decided rather than to make a whole new MK game, they'd make a
    game that focused on one particular character from the popular series; a mini MK
    if you will. They'd shine some light on his past and present gamers with a
    story, rather than mindless fights to win a tournament. The character of choice
    is Sub Zero, and the game is aptly titled Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub Zero.\n
    Mythologies remains true to its parent series (up until Mortal Kombat 4, anyway)
    in a few aspects: all the characters are digitized and the game is still 2D. But
    unlike the other games in the series, this one's a platform adventure. You're
    not just fighting to win a tournament, you're fighting to find out the entire
    back story of Sub Zero. Sure, you'll still be beating up lots of bad guys, but
    the game is basically a "jump from platform to platform" game. Midway even
    throws in some RPG elements, such as item collection and a menu screen, to spice
    things up a bit.\n
    Features:\n
    * Explore eight distinct worlds while battling more than 30 enemies\n
    * Perform ice blasts, super slides, polar blasts, and more\n
    * Defeat a total of 12 boss characters, including Scorpion, Quan Chi, and
    Shinnok

    Money earned by winning championships can be used to purchase additional
    vehicles, and for parts and tuning of all vehicles.

    Gran Turismo features 180 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as reversed
    versions). Two Honda del Sol cars from 1995 were included in the Japanese
    version, but were removed from the North American and European versions. They

    Francisco's Pac Bell Park are there too.\n
    Every player is also modeled as closely as possible after their real life

    new animations such as arguments with umpires, high-fives, end-of-game
    celebrations and player reactions to strikeouts and homers also help bring the

    Gamers who really want to immerse themselves in the experience can try out the

    home team makes an error.\n
    As an added bonus, EA has secured exclusive rights to the 500 Home Run Club,
    which means that gamers can step up to the plate as Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Hank
    Aaron or others, and take on today's top pitchers like Pedro Martinez or Randy
    Johnson. In addition, EA has exclusive rights to the MLBPA Big League Challenge,

    The game consists of 43 pre-rendered levels and 12 boss characters, all of which

    In order to clear a level, Charlie must locate a certain number of time clocks
    and hit them with his wrench. To reach the clocks, he'll need to walk across
    narrow ledges, spinning gears, and past open flames. Besides using the wrench,
    Charlie can also jump, throw bolts and roll away. Items to look out for are
    paper airplanes (they'll give you information or clues), donuts to replenish any
    damage, coins to give you extra lives and fans to cool you down. After all,
    moving through a hot steel factory can be especially dangerous to an egg. The
    game automatically saves your progress to memory card, so keep moving and save
    that factory!

    The most notable feature of the game is the number of impressive CG cinemas that
    play constantly throughout your adventure. If you fall off an edge, you'll see

    In One Piece Mansion, you control Polpo, a manager in charge of building and
    maintaining an apartment complex inhabited by a host of wacky residents. Your
    overall job is to keep tenants happy by keeping their stress levels under
    control. Each inhabitant raises and/or lowers the stress in rooms around them in
    a particular pattern. For example, Ai-Chan decreases the stress in all the rooms
    around her, while Heebee increases the stress in the room directly above him.\n
    The game largely consists of arranging and moving tenants so their stress
    causing and reducing abilities balance out. If a resident's stress level gets
    too high, their apartment explodes. As long as you have a building full of happy
    residents, you'll receive rent checks at the end of every month. But for each
    room that explodes, you lose a certain amount of cash.\n
    You also have to deal with the members of the crime organization Syndicate 5,
    who take over rooms without paying rent and add extra stress to your paying
    dwellers. The goal is to increase Syndicate 5 members' stress until they can't
    stand to live in your complex anymore. And if the criminals wander around,
    bothering other people, you must drive them back into their rooms personally
    using your security whistle. Fires pose an additional source of turmoil, and
    these must be dealt with on a one-on-one basis using the fire extinguisher.\n
    One Piece Mansion's Story Mode revolves around Polpo's sister being kidnapped by
    a jealous building owner, and consists of a series of stages with specific
    goals, such as earning $10,000 or building a complex with 30 rooms. The Endless
    Mode allows you to build to your heart's content, or at least until you run out

    Command & Conquer: Red Alert for the PlayStation is a conversion of the hit
    computer game of the same name. The game involves commanding either the Soviets
    or Allies through 14 different missions, which vary depending on the side you
    choose. In order to amass your troops (consisting of tanks, infantry, naval and
    air forces), you must first build various structures with your available funds.
    Each map screen will have two types of natural resources (ore and gemstones)
    that can be collected to finance your operation. Missions generally involve
    building a base, mining resources and generating a mix of troops to mount an
    assault on the enemy's base.\n
    The PlayStation version supports the mouse and includes a Skirmish mode, which
    lets you face up to three computer opponents on 20 different maps in an all-out
    battle for domination. Want to start out with more credits or troops? How about
    increase the game speed? These options can all be adjusted before you begin a
    game. The PlayStation version also supports the Link Cable so you can battle a
    second player head to head or with computer-controlled AI teams. Twenty-one
    music tracks will keep your foot tapping as you wage war, and a password save
    feature will allow you to continue your single-player missions at a later time.

  developer: Electronic Arts

  description:
    Viewpoint is an arcade isometric shooter, released in 1992 by SNK for the
    Neo-Geo arcade platform. By default, 1P and 2P can only play one after another;
    in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled.\n
    The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done
    visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game
    with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same.\n
    Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of
    Zaxxon. The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with
    texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded
    polygons.\n
    One or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship
    equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting
    button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special
    weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a
    nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.\n
    Viewpoint features six robot riddled worlds set throughout a three-quarter
    perspective. Growing in complexity as the game progresses, the levels have been
    rendered with computer-generated SGI textures, enemies, and various explosion
    effects. At the end of certain levels, players will square off against large
    mechanized bosses.\n
    Far into the future of mankind's existence, the world is being threatened by its
    own mechanical creations. After being banished to the 31st sector of the galaxy,
    the Ralfedacc has began orbiting around Earth. Those in the death orb more
    commonly known as the Director of the Dark have created destructive robots that
    will be deployed on the seemingly helpless planet; their ultimate objective is
    revenge.\n
    Naturally, you've been selected as the Byupo probe pilot that will save the
    world; no pressure, eh? A Byupo is a small yet powerful fighter ship capable of
    mass devastation; it can pick up and use various weapons and utilize special
    items. Your mission objective is short and to the point: pilot your craft with a
    quick trigger finger throughout six key battle areas.\n
    The Byupo can obtain sidecars, or helper items and/or weapons, during each
    levels. Players can utilize homing bombs that targets enemies in clusters, the
    wall of flame that emits from a dropped fire bomb, and a wave bomb that sends
    out a lightning attack. Additionally, power bubbles equip your shooter with
    temporary shields and the bonus Byupo acts as an extra-life.\n
    But watch out -- there are a variety of traps and hazards built to terminate
    your quest. In addition to trap doors, the enemies have erected draw gates to
    hamper your progress. You'll have to destroy the wheel locks if you wish to make
    it through the gate. The Gears of Gore move on tracks and do devastating amounts
    of damage; avoid these at all costs!

    Warcraft II: The Dark Saga brings the successful Warcraft series to the console
    world, delivering medieval orc vs. human combat to those that haven't been able
    to enjoy the PC version. Warcraft II is a real-time strategy game that requires
    players to build up orc and human forces by building structures and creating
    units for combat. The main objective is to take control of one race and wipe the
    other one completely off of the map.\n
    The console version of Warcraft II sports some changes from its PC predecessor.
    First and foremost, both the original version of Warcraft II as well as the
    expansion pack are included. This means twice as many maps and four separate
    campaigns, giving players 52 different missions split between the races. Other
    additions include six new full-motion video cut-scenes, and the ability to group
    sixteen units instead of nine. Also included are extra production options,
    meaning that if you control multiple bases, it will be easier to maintain one
    while focusing your attention on the other.\n
    While Warcraft II: The Dark Saga only features single-player missions, players
    can create their own maps, as well as use custom mission maps that the game
    includes to make their own scenarios.

    In order for her spell to gain ultimate power to work she must sacrifice a

    Xena, Warrior Princess to save her.\n

    really no choice; you must stop Kalabrax before all you hold dear crumbles in an
    instant.\n

    Crusaders, led by Clan Jade Falcon, seek to launch another attack into the Inner
    Sphere. The Warden faction, led by Clan Wolf, believe that coexistence with the
    Inner Sphere is the best choice. The war will ultimately dictate which faction
    dominates the Clans.\n
    You can play as either a Clan Jade Falcon or Clan Wolf MechWarrior and command a
    range of mechs ranging from light scout to heavy 100 ton assault mechs. Before
    missions, each player can select one or more mechs for his or her unit as well
    as customize equipment and weaponry. Although there is no restriction to stop
    you from taking the maximum number and tonnage complement, the Clans reward
    players who take fewer mechs or less tonnage than allowed.\n
    The game's 3D world is viewed from a first-person perspective. Mission
    objectives must be completed while evading or destroying enemy mechs. During
    missions, each player must manage their mechs' heat level and ammunition, as
    well as command the CPU-controlled friendly mechs to organize strategy. Missions
    end in failure if the objective is lost or if mechs are destroyed through damage
    or overheating.

    With no stat tweaking and no licenses, Tennis Arena is arcade-style tennis at

    What you have here is single-match or tournament play for up to four players
    with wacky characters and a few different courts to play on. You can play an
    obese Chinese man, for example, and compete in a Roman coliseum whose clay
    surface seems to affect bounce marginally. That's about it for options though.
    No sim, Tennis Arena serves up roughly the same level of fun as Pong did 25
    years ago, albeit now with prettier graphics and the occasional super smash.\n
    The game also features special shots, with visible trails, fighter-plane-like
    sound effects, and higher ball speed. These must be earned however. After
    successfully returning the ball over the net six consecutive times, a yellow
    star appears under the character. You may then attempt to use the special shot,
    which entails lining up with the ball just right - but a failed special shot
    doesn't erase the stored potential.

    Using a Tom Clancy storyline and characters, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six for the
    PlayStation is an original first person 3D shooter where you take control of an
    elite counter-terrorist organization named Rainbow Six. After selecting one of
    three difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate or Special Forces), you select a
    team of operatives from a full roster. You can also equip your team with the
    appropriate weapons and equipment based on real-life munitions (even in Sniper
    Mode).\n
    To further realism you can select where each team member begins. After planning,
    lead your team into the mission where you get to control each member, one at a
    time. Also, as in real life, one shot may often maim or kill your operatives. If
    all of your operatives are killed, your mission ends. You must then choose to
    either move on with new operatives or retry the mission.\n
    If you complete all of your objectives you move on to the next mission for a
    total of 14 different missions in real world locations. In addition to the
    regular missions, you are also given the option to train. In the training level
    you can practice controlling an operative in a non-threatening environment. This
    is where you really get to learn some important skills. There is an assault
    course, a shooting range, and a training mission.\n
    Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six includes many real-life weapons. They include guns,
    grenades and kits. Some guns include: the HK MP5A2, the preferred submachine gun
    of counter-terrorist operatives around the world; the CAR-15, a compact M-16;
    and the Benelli M1, a good tactical shotgun that is an essential weapon for many
    teams. Other weapons include Frag Grenades, Heartbeat Sensors and Demolition
    Kits.\n
    Uniforms are another essential piece of equipment for counter-terrorists. Some
    include the ever-popular light, medium and heavy uniforms, the desert uniform,
    and the Camo uniform -- all used in different environments. The game also
    features real time lighting and special effects for ultimate realism.

    based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features
    some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs.
    .
    Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's
    new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device.  Spider-Man must
    work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's
    theft.
    .
    This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but
    cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human
    Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.
    .
    Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational
    purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat,
    such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or
    building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find
    new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also
    prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is
    used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many
    sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and
    catch them off-guard.
    .
    Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By
    combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able
    to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee
    range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a
    number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.
    .
    Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or
    find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or
    just trying to avoid the police.
    .
    There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple
    unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.

    The sequel to the chaotic off-road rally racing game, Rally Cross.  The lead
    programmer, Mark Lyons, and the lead artist, Scott Atkins, from Rally Cross had
    left Sony and formed a new company, Idol Minds.  Rally Cross 2 was one of the
    first two games developed by Idol Minds. It was an attempt to build on the
    original, while creating a game with a simpler learning curve.
    .
    Rally Cross 2 retains the rough terrain of the original, with even more jumps
    and crashes.  Multi-tap and 4 player split screen were not included in the
    sequel, but 2 player split screen remained.   The ability to control attributes
    such as suspension, tires, and steering was added, as well as the ability to
    paint your car with a primary and detail color that can be picked from a large
    palette.
    .
    Once again the courses can be raised forwards or backwards, and in suicide
    mode(cars racing in opposite directions at the same time).  The multi-race,
    season mode, still exists.  One of the biggest additions is the track editor.
    There are a dozen or so different pieces that can be rotated and dropped into a
    2D grid to create completely new tracks.
    .
    The cars are still flipped upright with the shoulder buttons, but it now
    requires only a single button press instead of the multiple rocking motions in
    the original.  Handling has changed significantly since cars tend to fishtail
    around the corners instead of flip, but high speed crashes will still result in
    an upside down car.

  description:
    Psychic Detective is an innovative slant on the interactive movie. You're Eric
    Fox, a psychic detective who can transmit his psychic self to others, to see
    through their eyes and hear through their ears. That way you can find out things
    about the case you couldn't otherwise. He has been employed by a strange woman
    to discover the mystery behind the death of her father.\n
    The huge mystery starts with Eric meeting the beautiful young woman named Laina.
    She introduces you to the other members of her family. Once another character
    appears on screen, an icon with their face on appears on the border. Click on
    this icon, and Eric will be able to delve into that person?s mind. This comes in
    handy for getting to know who is suspicious and who is innocent. As you can
    guess, the game is packed full of characters, so the mystery will take a heck of
    a long time to finish.\n
    Eric is able to receive weird psychic flashbacks, which usually feature either
    scenes of murder, sex or just suspicious goings on. He can influence the
    behaviour of other characters (annoy them, seduce them, etc.). As well as
    people, the smallest of items can give vital clues, even a stubbed out
    cigarette. It all depends on how carefully you watch the screen border. Special
    ?Psychic Collectors? must be picked up ? these can magnify Eric?s psychic
    powers. When one is activated, the screen goes into a swirl of colours, and
    presents the player with a variety of choice s. As the game progresses, Eric
    gets to play the Black Diamond game. This is a psychic battle which takes place
    on a board, but it?s a bit strange.\n
    The game has many different conclusions. It's a dark story though, and most
    people might not want to play through again.\n
    It?s gonna be a big mystery to solve. Heck, there are three CDs for this thing!
    Clues to the mystery are everywhere, and by touching certain objects Eric can
    reveal their history. All this is viewed from a first person perspective as Eric
    chats to all the other characters\n
    In the PSX version of the game you can save the game anywhere and at anytime
    except during the Black Diamond games. There are some scenes that are removed
    comparing to the Pc and 3do versions of the game.

  description:
    In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest,
    where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved.
    .
    Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a
    virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like
    arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome
    other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.
    .
    Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a
    "wire framed" virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but
    rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the
    player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and
    heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of
    twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added
    firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control
    it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.
    .
    Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in

    BattleTanx: Global Assault makes its PlayStation debut with more levels than the
    earlier Nintendo 64 version. Split-screen multiplayer support is also included,
    but for two players instead of four. The fast-paced action involves motoring
    across grid-like environments in one of 13 well-outfitted tanks. Solo players
    can complete 40 search-and-destroy missions in the campaign mode, while up to
    two friends can blast each other to scrap metal in seven deathmatch,
    capture-the-flag, and tag variants. Twenty power-ups are available in total,
    ranging from cloaking and teleporting devices to plasma bolts and guided
    missiles. Featured levels take place in futuristic versions of San Francisco,
    Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin, all of which are home to ruthless,
    tank-driving gangs.
    .
    Prior to the game's beginning, Griffin Spade set about reclaiming his lost love
    and establishing his tribe in San Francisco. But the peace he'd blasted out for
    himself looks to be short-lived as he's having frequent nightmares about a
    sinister QueenLord. It's up to Griffin to mount up again and with all the
    finesse that a giant tank can muster and solve the mystery behind this evil
    woman. And so the stage is set for Battle Tanx: Global Assault.

    collect the tokens and fruit that are scattered about. Collecting 100 tokens
    earns an extra life, and the fruit can be used to dispose of enemies. If you can
    collect the four pieces of Jane's baboon drawing, you can earn the chance to
    play a bonus level. You've got to help the young ape-man discover his place in

    around the board and explode as much stuff as you can. Of course as in the
    original, lots of power-ups are available to add to the excitement and bring new
    strategic considerations into the mix. A single-player "story mode" is
    available, but the most significant advance in this version of the classic game
    is that it allows up to five players to compete at once.\n
    The "Battle Royal Mode" allows competitors to challenge one another in the
    classic Bomberman setting and a "Custom Battle Mode" let's players tweak the
    options and settings to their liking. As frantic as a good single-player game of
    Bomberman can be, five people playing on the same screen can increase the frenzy
    exponentially.\n
    Features:\n
    Play alone through 50 stages or compete with friends in "Battle Royal" or

    the first representative of Earth sent to compete in a galaxy-wide race. This
    isn't an ordinary race, however -- an unknown alien race built magnificent
    rails/tracks throughout the confines of space. Spanning thousands of miles in
    length, rails act in such a way that when pilots navigate toward one, it
    increases the speed of the ship.
    .
    As Conner, your overall objective is to bring home the ultimate reward -- the
    globe-like Starsphere. While your mission sounds fairly basic, it won't be easy;
    there are seven other pilots vying for the same prize. Residing in the far
    reaches of the Milky Way, competition includes a half man/half machine humanoid
    named Ko-Axe, the vengeful Tianna Stone, and an overconfident egomaniac that
    goes by the name of Dextor -- The Terrible. There are also drone pilots that
    fill in the rest of the playing field.
    .
    Broken into quadrants, there are 44 different rails/tracks in which to race on;
    there are ten races per quadrant. While the bulk of the game is played against
    computer-controlled opposition, there are times when you'll race against the
    clock in a true test of speed and accuracy. Prove yourself worthy and you'll
    race against an elite group of pilots through Epsilon Indi -- the final railway.
    If you manage to win this final race, the Starsphere is as good as yours!

    where the fireworks begin. Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted
    completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning
    terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on
    duty, so you must confront the danger.
    .
    There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only
    rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more
    advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and
    civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if
    mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their
    natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already
    started.
    .
    The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments
    range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police
    office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them
    crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional
    RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers,
    you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike
    from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite
    powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will
    deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the
    longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the
    game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items,
    or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects.
    The same is true for armor Aya finds.

    Pro 18: World Tour Golf attempts to bring the authenticity of golf to the
    PlayStation console by incorporating real-life courses and world-renowned PGA
    and LPGA tournament players. Included is the 1998 United States PGA champion
    Vijay Singh and Mark O'Mera, who won both the 1998 Masters tournament and
    British Open championship. There are eight players in all with the ability to
    create your own golfer.\n
    There are various game modes including Practice, Stroke Play, Fourball, Shoot
    Out, Skins, and a Tournament. In the Practice mode, you can practice putting,
    driving, and chipping the ball on the course and hole of your choice. This is
    ideal for new players unfamiliar with the ways of professional golf. Stroke Play
    is simply nine or 18 holes of golf where players try to finish with as few
    strokes as possible.\n
    The Fourball option includes two teams of two golfers competing for the lowest
    score. One person hits the ball and the other team must beat or match that
    person's score. Whoever has the lowest number of strokes on a hole wins and tees
    off on the next hole. A Shoot Out involves a money-based tournament where
    players compete on a hole-to-hole basis. Whoever finishes the hole with the
    lowest score wins a sum of survival money; whoever has the most strokes is
    eliminated. Skins is much like the Shoot Out only players aren't eliminated and
    the hole payments are much more.\n
    Finally the Tournament consists of four rounds of golf played in the span of
    four days. There are initially 72 golfers competing throughout the first two
    days; at the end of the second day, the 36 best golfers advance while the other
    half is cut from the tournament. In order to win money, players must finish
    somewhere in the top 18.\n
    Pro 18: World Tour Golf is played with a 4-click swing meter that allows you to
    apply spin and add extra oomph to your shots. It allows you to draw or fade
    around obstacles (hitting the ball left or right), chip from the fairway, and
    other things found in professional golf. There are three different real-life
    courses to play though including the Ireland based Royal County Down, The Lost
    City located in South Africa, and the United State's Coeur d'Alene.\n
    Additionally, Pro 18: World Tour Golf supports the PlayStation's Multi Tap for
    up to eight players. Customized golfers, tournament settings and advancements,
    and course statistics can be saved via Memory Card.

  developer: Acclaim
  publisher: Acclaim
  description:
    Chef hosts this Acclaim title, which mixes South Park trivia with mini games in
    the mold of Mario Party (Nintendo 64). The idea is you choose your favourite
    South Park kid (Kyle, Kenny, Stan or Cartman) and answer the questions based on
    episodes from the cartoon series. If you get it right, you then spin the wheel,
    and you either get the cash, lose it all, or play a mini game (either by
    yourself, against the AI, or against your friends if you're in multiplayer
    mode). The person who has the highest score (or the most correct answers) after
    a chosen amount of rounds wins.

  developer: Virgin
  publisher: Virgin
  description:
    Grid Runner is a futuristic version of "tag." On offense, your objective is to
    capture the flags around the levels without being tagged or killed. On defense,
    your main objective is to tag the other player (either the computer or a friend
    in two-player mode) before he or she collects all the flags.\n
    In each level you will find different colored balls that will help you defeat
    your enemies. For example, the green balls increase your speed, red increases
    your magic, and blue increases your agility. The more power-ups you collect, the
    more efficient you become. You can also use and collect magic points.\n
    Collecting magic points allows you to do one of six things: build a temporary
    bridge, drop explosives behind you, slow down your opponent, fire a weapon
    (which can be upgraded or traded), temporarily boost your speed, or teleport out
    of danger.

    female magician. Together, they start a journey in order to discover the unknown
    foes which have corrupted Ashley, but soon they find out that a much greater
    conspiracy has taken place...
    .
    The combat system in "Wild Arms" is very similar to the one in Final Fantasy
    games: turned-based attacks, and a menu choice of physical attacks, spells, and
    even Guardians, which are more or less the same like the Guardian Forces in
    "Final Fantasy VIII". The "Arms" are special abilities which the party members
    learn while progressing in the game.
    .
    "Wild Arms 2" also has many adventure elements, which links it to Nintendo's
    Zelda games. The dungeons (which can - and must - be viewed rotating the camera)
    contain many puzzles to solve.

    up. Blocks can be removed in several ways using combos, enclosures, lines, and
    pyramid stones. Each mode features a unique objective, ranging from solving 50
    Sphinx riddles in Mystery mode to the frenetic ten-stage action of Time Attack.

  description:
    Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98 is an ice hockey game for the Nintendo 64 and
    PlayStation, it was released in 1997. The game is endorsed by hockey star, Wayne
    Gretzky and is the sequel to Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey.\n
    The game gained widespread criticism for several perceived shortcomings. The
    game was perceived to be crude and unfitting as a pure hockey simulator, leaving
    many enthusiasts disappointed, but many arcade fans delighted.\n
    Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98 continues same fast-paced, arcade-style spin that
    made its predecessor a system standout. The sequel retains the same look and
    feel as the original while adding new features to give players more choices in
    managing their teams.\n
    Both arcade and simulation play styles are available, with the latter expanding
    the roster size from 11 to 17 athletes; incorporating both injuries and fatigue;
    and recording team and league leader statistics throughout the season.
    Customization options include seven camera angles, toggles for penalties and
    fights, two game speeds, adjustable period lengths, and five difficulty
    levels.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    Gameplay consists of two basic options: Arcade and Simulation. Although the
    graphics and earlobe vary little between the two, other changes have the effect
    of changing the chemistry and intensity of gameplay between the two options. The
    gamer has the ability to customize period length, fatigue (on/off), line
    changes, fighting (on/off), penalties (simulation only), rink size (arcade
    only), puck-streak (on/off), and camera angle.\n
    Simulation Mode:\n
    Simulation mode is designed to emulate the real game of hockey. Players may play
    five, four, or three to a side, depending on preference. Recognition of
    penalties, off-sides, and icing are all optional, but two-line pass is not
    considered. Period length can be selected between 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.\n
    Arcade Mode:\n
    During the Arcade mode checking, hooking, and tripping are more violent. Fights
    occur with greater frequency, and penalties are disregarded entirely.
    Additionally, arcade mode sees the introduction of a "power shot", which a
    player may utilize to light the net on fire after a goal. Arcade mode tends to
    be more exciting.

    The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny
    Funny, and going out on a date with her.  But what he lacks is confidence - help
    PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more,
    all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!
    .
    PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself
    is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll
    see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by
    pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and
    you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to
    distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll
    fail the stage.
    .
    Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them -
    you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes,
    and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will
    step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!
    .
    The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However,
    it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game
    sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song
    remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.

  game: Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? : 2nd Edition
  file: Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - 2nd Edition (USA).zip
  developer: Eidos Interactive
  publisher: Eidos Interactive
  description:
    Trivia buffs and Regis Philbin fans unite -- you can now play the popular ABC
    game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire on your PlayStation console. Who Wants
    to be a Millionaire - 2nd Edition features 600 new questions and more smarmy
    commentary from the suave, aforementioned host.\n
    If you have been living under an Atari 2600 and are new to the Millionaire
    phenomena, you should know that players sitting in the hot seat must answer 15
    multiple choice questions in order to win $1,000,000. If you want a chance at a
    cool million in the two-player mode of this game show simulation, you must first
    win a fastest finger contest in which you place items (such as films or states)
    in their proper order.\n
    Once you take the hot seat, Regis Philbin will give you a question with four
    possible answers. Answer it correctly (within the 30-second time limit) and you
    will win $100. Each ensuing question promises a bigger payoff. The questions
    start off relatively simple and get progressively more difficult as you work
    your way up the monetary ladder.\n
    From time to time, the host will ask: "Is that your final answer?" If you press
    no, you will be given 10 seconds to change your answer. Once you answer the
    $1,000 question, you are guaranteed at least that amount of money. If you manage
    to make it over the $32,000 hump, you will take home at least that much cash.\n
    If you get stuck on a question, you can use a lifeline. All three lifelines from
    the television show are included: Ask the Audience, in which you can poll the
    in-studio viewers; Phone a Friend, which lets you call a (computerized) pal for
    help; and 50/50, in which the computer takes away two of the wrong answers. You
    can use each lifeline only once. If you've used up all your lifelines, you don't
    know the answer and you don't want to risk going down to $1,000 or $32,000, you
    can simply quit the game and walk away with earnings received thus far.\n
    The game ends when you walk away, run out of time, miss a question or win a
    fantasy check for $1,000,000. A special Tonight's Leaderboard screen posts a
    list of the top 10 winners and their prize money.\n
    Features:\n
    Answer 600 all-new questions presented by Regis Philbin\n

  developer: Activision

  description:
    After firing your grappling hook to the rooftop of a small house, you pull
    yourself up and notice a guard pacing back and forth on the ground. He doesn't
    see you as you begin to crawl and sneak around on the roof. If he detects your
    presence, you will be in a world of hurt; you will blow your mission and risk
    death. Patiently, you wait for the right time to jump down -- and end his life
    while his back is turned.\n
    Set in 16th century Japan, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins is a simulation of the ways
    of the stealthy ninja. You'll chose between two characters, Rikimaru and Ayame,
    with a main objective of remaining unseen throughout ten non-linear missions.
    You will move through the shadows, make your way across rooftops, dash through
    trees -- anything to cloak yourself from enemy sight. While completing the
    missions, you are judged on three levels that measure your success in the fields
    of elusiveness and effectiveness.\n
    Each mission is different in its design and goal. Your mentor will have you run
    secret errands to informants, kill evil merchants and thieves, and rescue
    captive ninjas. Along the way, the enemy resistance has set up traps and
    assigned guards to keep a watchful eye for any interference (that would be you).
    Because Tenchu is a simulation of sorts, running up and engaging an enemy combat
    is not advised -- that's not the way of the ninja.\n
    A ninja is cunning and in order to uphold his duty, he must remain unseen. If
    you brazenly walk up to a group of enemies and try to kill them all, you may get
    through a couple, but you will ultimately fail and dishonor your people. As far
    as weaponry goes, make use of throwing stars and actual ninja assassin swords.
    For the truly cunning players, poisoned rice and smoke bombs are included as
    special items. If a guard will not go away, try putting some rice down for him
    to eat - he'll get sick and collapse.

    Psychic Detective is an innovative slant on the interactive movie. You're Eric
    Fox, a psychic detective who can transmit his psychic self to others, to see
    through their eyes and hear through their ears. That way you can find out things
    about the case you couldn't otherwise. He has been employed by a strange woman
    to discover the mystery behind the death of her father.\n
    The huge mystery starts with Eric meeting the beautiful young woman named Laina.
    She introduces you to the other members of her family. Once another character
    appears on screen, an icon with their face on appears on the border. Click on
    this icon, and Eric will be able to delve into that person?s mind. This comes in
    handy for getting to know who is suspicious and who is innocent. As you can
    guess, the game is packed full of characters, so the mystery will take a heck of
    a long time to finish.\n
    Eric is able to receive weird psychic flashbacks, which usually feature either
    scenes of murder, sex or just suspicious goings on. He can influence the
    behaviour of other characters (annoy them, seduce them, etc.). As well as
    people, the smallest of items can give vital clues, even a stubbed out
    cigarette. It all depends on how carefully you watch the screen border. Special
    ?Psychic Collectors? must be picked up ? these can magnify Eric?s psychic
    powers. When one is activated, the screen goes into a swirl of colours, and
    presents the player with a variety of choice s. As the game progresses, Eric
    gets to play the Black Diamond game. This is a psychic battle which takes place
    on a board, but it?s a bit strange.\n
    The game has many different conclusions. It's a dark story though, and most
    people might not want to play through again.\n
    It?s gonna be a big mystery to solve. Heck, there are three CDs for this thing!
    Clues to the mystery are everywhere, and by touching certain objects Eric can
    reveal their history. All this is viewed from a first person perspective as Eric
    chats to all the other characters\n
    In the PSX version of the game you can save the game anywhere and at anytime
    except during the Black Diamond games. There are some scenes that are removed
    comparing to the Pc and 3do versions of the game.

  description:
    Dragonheart: Fire and Steel was released to the public in 1996, and is a 2D side
    scrolling beat 'em up based off of the movie of the same name. Players take on
    the role of a retired knight who must return to action and remain true to the
    oaths he took long ago. An evil prince's tyranny threatens the land, and the
    knight (who was a former dragonslayer) can only defeat this scheming noble with
    the help of a friend who just happens to be the last surviving dragon on Earth.
    .
    Players must punch, kick, and slash their way through multiple levels in their
    quest, facing off against both weak and powerful enemies bent on stopping them.
    At the end of each level boss characters stand ready to slay the player, who
    must defeat them to continue, for retreat is not an option. Rendered and
    digitized graphics are used in the game to represent the backgrounds and
    characters respectively, though the title runs in a low graphic resolution.

    Tekken is an arcade fighting game franchise created and developed by Namco.
    Beginning with the original Tekken arcade game released in 1994, the series has
    received several sequels, as well as various home conversions and spin-off
    titles released for consoles. The story in each game in the main series
    documents the events of the fictional martial arts tournament, The King of Iron
    Fist Tournament, which is hosted by the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation. The prize
    is typically control of the company, which then allows the winner to host the
    following tournament.\n
    The arcade versions of the game have traditionally used PlayStation based
    hardware to run the games, and subsequently each Tekken installment was
    eventually made for its respective PlayStation.

  description:
    Take to the streets on one of ten stylin' boards in the first skateboarding game
    for the PlayStation, courtesy of Electronic Arts and Micro Cabin. Two variations
    of play include the Street Tour Mode, where you skate through three 3D courses
    trying to pull off as many tricks as you can within a time limit, and Free Skate
    Mode, where you either play for points or practice your moves without worrying
    about the clock.\n
    Skaters can also play against a friend in Versus Mode to see who can pull off
    the most tricks. Street Sk8ter features 200 different moves and combinations to
    perform while racing, each of which earns your skater points depending on its
    level of difficulty. Of course, if you wipe out, you'll have points deducted
    from your score. Three other "traditional" areas are available, including a
    Half-Pipe, Big Air and Bowl.\n
    The main aspect of the game is the Street Tour, which is structured similar to a
    racing game: weave your way down sidewalks and streets, pass through checkpoints
    to extend your time, and finish before the clock winds down to zero. Along the
    way there will be plenty of opportunities to catch some air and perform tricks
    with the pad. The goal is to score as many points as possible with one of four
    alter-egos: TJ, Jerry, Ginger and Frankie.\n
    Each skater also differs in style (Goofy or Regular) and has individual ratings
    in jump power, cornering, maximum speed and acceleration. Playing through the
    Street Tour with different characters allows you to open up additional routes,
    unlock bonus skaters and reveal new decks (designs on the main platform area of
    a board). You'll even get to increase your character's overall ratings!\n
    After finishing each course, players will also be able to watch their
    performance on instant replay. Other notable features include: Dual Shock
    Controller support (vibration only), best times saved to memory card, an
    announcer, deck graphics from Powell Skateboards, and twelve alternative music
    tracks from bands under the Epitaph and Capitol Records labels.

    While avoiding the treacherous chasms and gaps that permeate the floating

    time remaining to complete each world. Continues are unlimited so failure is
    little more than a temporary hindrance.

    Gun, Firestorm Homing Missile, Rocket Pod, Runaway Cratering System (bombs), the
    Mk-84 500-Pound Bomb, Cluster Bombs, and the Anti-Ship Missile. These weapons --
    plus excellent evasive, and attack maneuvers -- should be enough to help you
    succeed in attacks on drug runners and terrorists, from Columbia to Iraq.\n
    Thunder Strike 2 is the sequel to Core's Amiga, ST, PC & Sega CD game, AH-3

    Front Mission 3 is the third main entry and the fifth entry overall in the Front
    Mission series. Like other Front Mission titles, Front Mission 3 is part of a
    serialized storyline that follows the stories of various characters and their
    struggles involving mecha known as wanzers.\n
    While it is a tactical role-playing game, there is a stronger emphasis on
    role-playing elements as opposed to strategic elements in Front Mission 3. The
    game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions,
    set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player
    travels to locations on a world map. As the player progresses through the plot,
    new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as
    intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the
    upcoming mission. New to Front Mission 3 is the Double Feature Scenario - this
    allows the player to experience two different scenarios that exist independently
    of one another within the game's storyline. In other words, the player can play
    through two stories; while they may share common events and environments, the
    stories are largely unique and in essence are fully-fledged games.

    The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny
    Funny, and going out on a date with her.  But what he lacks is confidence - help
    PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more,
    all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!
    .
    PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself
    is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll
    see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by
    pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and
    you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to
    distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll
    fail the stage.
    .
    Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them -
    you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes,
    and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will
    step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!
    .
    The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However,
    it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game
    sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song
    remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.

    rectangular blocks by rotating and moving them so their stars line up. Each
    block is the same size and contains either one or two stars. Your well is
    constantly being filled with blocks that rise from the bottom of the screen, and
    the blocks that you place yourself can be placed anywhere they will fit.\n
    The One-Player Mode is an endless mode where you play until the blocks reach the
    top of the screen. Story Mode is a series of vs. battles. In this mode, clearing
    multiple blocks and starting chain reactions dumps obstacles on top of your
    opponent's playfield. But watch out, because the same can be done to you. The
    gameplay in VS Mode is the same as in the Story Mode, except you compete against
    another human player. Attack Mode is a collection of six challenges that revolve
    around completing specific tasks, such as making as many chains as possible or
    going for a high score.\n
    One notable feature in Puzzle Star Sweep is the concept of "stardust," which
    functions as points that go toward unlocking bonus features. Stardust is earned

    the track by a force beam, and each ship draws energy directly from the force
    beams. Energy to your ship can be drained by taking corners too fast, firing
    your weapons, getting hit by enemy fire, colliding with other ships, and by
    simply driving the ship. You can increase your energy by picking up power-ups
    that you'll find along the tracks. Each ship comes with a few extra engine power
    cells which can be used to break the sound barrier.\n
    Cyberspeed is broken up into three different kinds of races: Tournament Race,
    Free Race, and Time Trial. The tournament consists of ten different basic races
    against seven opponents, with additional bonus races that pit you against Super
    Ships. The Free Race is a single race against seven opponents, and you can only
    race on the first two tracks or on ones that you have already completed. The
    Time Trial is similar to the Free Race, but with only two pilots competing. In
    each of the three kinds of races, you can choose between eight different ships.
    Each ship is ranked according to thrust, mass, speed, and shield strength, and
    each ship is equipped with the same kinds of weapons: plasma bolts, missiles,

  description:
    Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has
    released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the
    long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim's bodies into
    grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous
    brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either
    his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his
    daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam
    the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it
    all, Adam Crowley.
    .
    Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and
    Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving,
    an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill
    monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just
    kill them using basic weapons.

  game: The Legend of Dragoon
  file: Legend of Dragoon, The (USA) (Disc 4).zip
  developer: Sony
  publisher: Sony
  description:
    Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers
    were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was
    the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies.
    Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent
    uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this,
    the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses,
    which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun
    as the past and future are about to collide...\n
    In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll
    travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well
    as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at
    once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference
    being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the
    souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and
    even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.\n
    Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a
    fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the
    party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known
    as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's
    ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an
    attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you
    press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center
    rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more
    hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.\n
    Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind,
    earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an
    enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another
    unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It
    allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button
    appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of
    the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small
    amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not
    properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a
    result.\n
    Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows,
    axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other
    items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to
    enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins
    with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in
    chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the
    in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors.
    There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle,
    found in chests, or purchased from merchants.\n
    Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to
    avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run
    into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you
    find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks
    of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and
    vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.

  game: The Granstream Saga

  developer: Sony Computer Entertainment
  publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment
  description:
    One hundred years ago, the planet of Granstream was ravaged by a war between the
    Imperial Wizardry and the Allied Spirit Army. To break the deadlock, the
    Imperial Wizardry unleashed a forbidden weapon long since banned by both sides,
    causing the planet's axis to shift and flooding the world in the process. Four
    wise men, aligned to the elements of fire, water, earth, and wind, managed to
    raise four continents into the air, saving those they could. Now however, the
    descendants of the wise men responsible for this noble act have begun
    disappearing and reports emerge that Imperial airships have been spotted. Raised
    by a kindly man by the name of Valos, it falls to Eon, a young orphaned boy
    whose wrist is adorned by a mysterious bracelet called a Scepter, to save the
    continents.\n
    A 3D polygonal RPG, The Granstream Saga presents players with the usual
    allotment of items, weapons, and equipment, the collection of which is necessary
    should Eon have a chance of saving the continents of Shilf, Aquas, Volcos, and
    Zephere. On his journey, Eon will be accompanied by two woman, Laramee and
    Arcia, and a bird named Korky, though only he will engage in battle. Movement
    throughout the world is viewed from an overhead perspective, while battles take
    place in real-time 3D. The battles, which consist primarily of one-on-one duels,
    allow players full control over the character's movement within the confines of
    the battle area. Magic and melee attacks provide the necessary offensive
    capabilities, though if required the player can use a shield to block enemy
    attacks or evade them by double-tapping the directional pad in a specific
    direction. Special abilities can be learned and subsequently implemented during
    battles, many of which are unique to the weapon type your character currently
    wields.\n
    Once learned, these skills can be executed with the proper D-pad movements.
    Daggers, axes, and short and long swords can be used in battle, each with unique
    damage potential and speed of use. Enemies can been seen in the overworld, and
    thus battles avoided at the whim of the player. Interspersed between the battles
    are puzzles that require solving before the player can progress. Critical
    junctures in the plot unfold via animated cutscenes, and hand-drawn character
    portraits accompany conversations with significant characters in the game.\n

    Engage in real-time 3D combat using weapons and magic spells\n

  description:
    Extreme Pinball is Epic Megagames' successor to Epic Pinball. It contains four
    pinball tables: Rock Fantasy, Medieval Knights, Urban Chaos, and Monkey Mayhem,
    each with a different theme. Compared to Epic Pinball, it has a larger, 320x400
    resolution, as well as taller tables, both allowing for more objects. It also
    has a typical Dot Matrix Display where the scoreboard shows 3D-rendered
    animations as well. The controls are more sensitive with a faster ball. This is
    less true to real pinball gameplay, but it speeds up the game's pace and gives
    more power to the player to influence the movement.

    As the sequel to 1997's #1 selling football game for the Sony PlayStation, NFL
    GameDay 99 offers several new features designed to improve the gameplay as well
    as the presentation. First off, the 3D graphics have returned but with double
    the amount of polygons--bringing the total close to 350 per player. The
    animations have also improved to deliver one-handed spinning catches, lunges and
    off-balanced throws. A new zooming camera system will bring you closer to the
    on-field action, with player photos and statistical updates during the game.\n
    For the first time in the GameDay series, NBC announcers Dick Enberg and Phil
    Simms will provide the play-by-play and color commentary, respectively. Over 500
    plays have been included along with thirty NFL teams and 1,500 players with
    ratings based on the 1998 season. The artificial intelligence has been refined
    to accurately model real-life defenses, with defensive backs backpedaling and
    shifting based on the player's offensive formations.\n
    NFL GameDay 99 also offers the following: the ability to create, draft, sign,
    trade or release players and free agents; four difficulty levels; three game
    styles (Arcade, Simulation and Total Control); multiple weather conditions;

    title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret
    "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and

    one-on-one fighter, features over-the-top special moves characteristic of WWF.
    Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game.
    Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the
    other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include
    single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one
    multiplayer.\n
    Step into the ring with eight of the biggest stars in the WWF including Brett
    The Hitman Hart and the Undertaker. Wear down the opposition with standard
    wrestling moves, and then climb the ropes for some high-flying action. If you
    are taking a beating, you can quickly turn things around by using one of the

  publisher: Electronic Arts
  description:
    Mattel's Hot Wheels has been one of the most popular toy franchises for boys and
    girls for over 30 years, on the same glorified popularity level as G.I. Joe and
    Barbie. Now get ready for pulse-pounding racing action as these die-cast race
    cars come to life on the PlayStation in Hot Wheels Turbo Racing. Developed by
    Stormfront Studios and published by Electronic Arts, the game features 11
    twisting tracks and plenty of stunts like flips, barrel rolls and 360-degree
    spins.\n
    Get behind the wheel of over 40 classic Hot Wheels cars including The Red Baron,
    Twin Mill (The King of Speed) and Super Van (5,000 pounds of car-smashing
    terror). Each car has its own strengths and weaknesses, so you'll have to
    experiment to find out which one is best suited to your driving style. You'll
    have your choice of many different tracks, some built for all out speed and
    others filled with loops and obstacles to challenge your stunt mastery.\n
    The gameplay consists of three different race modes and two practice modes.
    Perfect your style in the Practice mode, where one or two players try out
    available tracks to get familiar with the game (and to find hidden short cuts).
    You can also select Practice Airtime, which is a stunt training mode that allows
    you to try out different tracks to perfect your stunt and trick maneuvers. Then
    earn points in the Exhibition Race where you go head-to-head with a friend or a
    number of computer-controlled opponents in an all-out race. This includes
    Airtime Challenge, a one or two-player stunt battle, and the Hot Wheels Cup,
    which is a racing tournament event made up of a series of tracks. The better you
    perform in each race the more points you'll score. The driver with the most
    points at the end of the tournament will win.\n
    The game's tracks feature hidden cars, shortcuts and power-ups at various points
    along the courses. Power-ups include a Car of Steel that gives your vehicle
    maximum durability, spin-increasing Gyros that make stunt maneuvering easier,
    the bouncy Rubber Car, the power, handling and grip increasing Super Handling,
    Turbo Boosts and the 4X4 pickup that allows you to go off-road.\n
    Turbo Boosts play an important role in the game. This power allows you to blow
    away your opponents with an incredible boost of speed in addition to increasing
    your airtime for pulling off more impressive stunts. As you collect Turbo Boosts
    throughout the game, they will register on your onscreen Turbo Meter. You must
    use this power cautiously and at the right time to help you score points and win
    the race!\n
    Hot Wheels Turbo Racing uses one block of memory for saved games and is
    vibration function and analog control compatible. In-game options include
    adjustable difficulty levels, custom control configurations and the ability to
    change musical selections. The soundtrack offers musical tracks by actual bands
    such as Metallica's Fuel, Primus' Hampster Style, Mix Master Mike's Outee 360
    and The Reverend Horton Heat's Pride of San Jacinto.\n
    Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines. The race is about to begin!

    Straight out of the Arcade and into your home via the PlayStation is Hydro
    Thunder by Midway. Only two modes of play exist, race alone or against another
    player. There are no championships to race for or time trials to beat. Simply
    choose your track, select a boat, and head out to the water.\n
    While no special modes of play exist, there are tracks and boats to be unlocked.
    Hydro Thunder allows players access to three boats and three tracks at the start
    of the game. New boats will be released depending on your finish on each of the
    three tracks. A player must finish in one of the top three positions on each
    track for new boats to become available. Boats each have their own advantages in
    areas such as control, stability, and speed.\n
    Tracks are released in the same way as boats. A top three finish in each of the
    first three available tracks is needed in order to unlock new tracks. On the new
    tracks a top two finish will be required and so on. No difficulty settings are
    featured in Hydro Thunder but when new tracks are released they will contain an
    increased difficulty level. The first three tracks are considered easy, the next
    three medium, and the three after that hard.

    Point Blank 2 is the sequel to the now classic arcade game Point Blank, which
    was converted to the PlayStation in 1998. Using the Namco built GunCon (an
    arcade-like light gun), it offers 70 new shooting galleries, different party
    modes and a new single-player game.\n
    If you're playing single-player, you have a few options from which to choose.
    The arcade mode is simply 16 rounds (of either beginner, advanced or insane
    difficulty) selected randomly from the 70 different shooting galleries. You'll
    get to shave sheep by shooting off their wool, test your accuracy in one-shot,
    one-hit bouts and save Dr. Don and Dr. Dan from wacky situations. There is also
    an endurance mode in which you climb a tall tower to see how far you can get in
    three tries.\n
    Out is the old single-player role-playing game from the original and in is an
    action-packed adventure. There are four rides to choose from, each with their
    own theme (like a haunted house and a submarine). The objective is to gain clues
    to save the King's daughter. To get new players familiar with the game controls,
    there is also a practice mode.\n
    If you've got a friend or a group of friends, Point Blank 2 features a wide
    variety of different play modes. The arcade games are enabled as well as turf
    wars, tournaments and a team-play option. You can also give certain players
    handicaps or enable penalties. Up to 8 people can play by alternating Guncons.\n
    Point Blank 2 ships in two different packaging formats, one with a Guncon and
    one without.

    field specialist, Solid Snake. This time around, instead of fighting genetically
    engineered soldiers and saving the world from Metal Gear, you're in a combat
    simulator. Aboard the Discovery (the submarine that Solid Snake traveled upon
    before reaching Angel Island), you will prepare for the dangers ahead.

    For those that have yet to experience MGS, the gameplay is based around
    strategy, tactics and action. Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions's interface and

    that was included in MGS. This time, instead of just a few missions, you have
    nearly 150 different stages to play (300 including the Time Attack modes). Fans
    of MGS should be able to quickly pick up on the gameplay style. In fact, not
    only is the gameplay recognizable by fans of the original Metal Gear Solid, each

    The game's combat system is quite detailed, and might take a while to get used
    to. However, when mastered, it is relatively easy for Lin and Kotaro to dispatch
    multiple enemies quickly from different directions, while simultaneously
    avoiding the enemies thrusts and swipes. There is a single attack button, but
    combined with different directional buttons pressed in different combinations
    and held down for various intervals. There are different attack speeds which
    correlate to the weight of the equipped weapon, and this is displayed on the
    sword's 'check' window (also displayed is the sword's length and sharpness, and
    a brief description of the blade).

    NHL Powerplay 98 is a hockey game where the player can control a team of his
    choice to bring it to victory and glory. The game modes are the typical genre
    choices: Either a whole NHL season, the NHL playoffs or a league with 15
    national teams. The team logos and player names are official licensed but in
    contrast to NHL 98 it uses the data from 1996/1997.
    .
    The gameplay itself is more action oriented than a simulation and uses several
    shooting and pass variations which are activated with more or less complicated
    key combinations. Six camera angles and a instant replay feature complement the
    TV atmosphere.
    .
    The game also features several tactical possibilities. For eight game situations
    the player can choose between three behaviours, e.g. how the players set up
    shots in the offensive zone. During the season there is a option to trade
    players with other teams. Extensive mid-season statistics, which can be shown
    for every team in the league, help planning transfers and tactics.

    support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D
    models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's

    Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.

    The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while
    strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He
    comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it
    was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He
    hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize
    that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to
    return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the
    existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will
    also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly
    unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.
    .
    Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random
    battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character
    levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each
    battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of
    attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently.
    Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only
    as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount
    of stamina, which recovers as other characters act.
    .
    Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them
    can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the
    ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous
    play.

    dimensions. One dimension is our universe, and the other is the anti-universe.
    This universe is known as Pure Evil, and waits for the doors to open, since
    every five thousand years the four basic elements (earth, air, fire, water) are
    gathered around the fifth the perfect being (Leeloo).\n
    The two characters have different options available to them. Korben can use
    guns, while Leeloo can use grenades. This helps you in certain aspects of the

    What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono
    turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle,
    little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention,
    and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and
    space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering
    the one who would destroy the flow of time.
    .
    Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for
    such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat
    skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in
    power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" -
    special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in
    battle.
    .
    The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy
    games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo
    attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple
    Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using
    their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the
    enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them
    entirely.
    .
    The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time,
    which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option,
    which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds
    even more endings to the already existing ones.

    are now living beings bent on destruction. Of course, you get to play an
    integral role in the conflict as Sarge, a sergeant (you were expecting another

    Trump or trumps or trump suit are terms used in trick-taking games,
    traditionally called whist-style games although the best-known example may now
    be bridge, where cards of one suit rank above all non-trump cards, and
    automatically prevail over them, losing only to a higher trump if one is played
    to the same trick.\n
    In most games, trump cards cannot be played if the player has any cards of the
    suit led to the trick; in a few, trumps can be played at any time. Playing the
    first trump to an already-started trick is known as ruffing; if another player
    were to play a higher trump, that would be an overruff or more commonly an
    overtrump.\n
    Trump Shiyohyo! (or Card Shark in Europe) is a collection of card games that
    includes Poker, 21, Blackjack, etc. The gameplay is in first person perspective
    and the game features up to 4 human players to play at the same time using the

    The game stars Milo, a young, eager hero, and his rag-tag group of explorer pals
    -- the stern Captain Rourke, the formidable Helga, and the mulish Moliore.
    Players will control each of these characters over the course of the game, each
    with his or her own distinct power that must be used to get across, around, or
    through obstacles blocking their path.

  game: Colony Wars
  file: Colony Wars (USA) (Disc 1).zip
  developer: Psygnosis
  publisher: Psygnosis
  description:
    Since 3095, the Earth Empire has spread throughout the universe, taking what it
    wants and destroying the rest - all in the name of sustaining life on Earth.  To
    the Empire, expansion is of the utmost importance, even above famine, drought
    and death.
    .
    The League of Free Worlds exists to offer resistance and hope to the plundered
    outlying colonies.  After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire's Navy can
    be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell.
    .
    Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space.  You, as the player, join as
    a recruit in the League's fleet.  Missions take place in various fighters, from
    a 1st person view inside the cockpit, or a 3rd person view from behind your
    ship. Ships have separate meters for shields and armor, and the player must
    cycle between weapons designed specifically to damage each. At the most basic,
    purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers
    to destroy them.
    .
    The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as
    well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for
    as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their
    thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers. The campaign also
    features multiple endings and branching missions/storylines, based on your
    performance in the previous operations.

  game: Pro Pinball : Fantastic Journey

  developer: Take 2 Interactive
  publisher: Take 2 Interactive
  description:
    Pro Pinball: Fantastic Journey has many features one would expect to find on a
    standard pinball machine. You'll see bumpers, buzzers, bells, ramps, flippers,
    gates and plenty of lights. The machine also has a LCD screen where you see your
    score, current ball count and graphical outputs of on-screen adventure. An
    option is provided to make it a full color display or leave it in the
    traditional colors found on a standard pinball machine.\n
    Each of the machine's quests or adventures requires you to trigger spinners or
    buttons in order to advance; to even get a chance at a journey that will require
    you to hit a specific "lit" area of the playing surface. Several other features,
    such as multipliers and multi-balls have also been included. The game boasts
    accurate physics that allow the ball to spin, jump, roll and slide.\n
    Several external features have been incorporated in order to offer a more
    realistic Arcade experience. For instance, the machine can actually be nudged to
    simulate aggression or to move a ball one direction; too much abuse of this
    option can cause a "tilt," at which point the machine resets with your current
    ball lost. Several other options can also be selected, such as the difficulty of
    the game and selecting one of three different camera angles.\n
    Two other features are included in an attempt to heighten the realism of the
    game. The first is the customization of flipper power, which allows you to alter
    how hard or soft the flippers hit the ball during gameplay. The second feature,
    which is machine condition, allows you to decide how well the pinball machine is
    maintained and, therefore, how accurate and true your game will be.\n
    Features:\n
    * View the 3D table from three different angles\n
    * Includes a full-color dot matrix display\n
    * Adjust options such as flipper power, table age, and more

  description:
    adidas Power Soccer 98 is the fourth and final title in the Psygnosis series.
    Offering the classic mix of arcade and simulated gameplay from the previous
    games, this edition updates the game twelve different types of tournaments and
    cups, eleven international leagues, 120 national teams and about 30 different
    stadia to play in.
    .
    Aside from the classic gameplay players have different moves such as
    flick-passes, short dribbles, and sliding tackles. In both both (arcade modes
    and simulation), there is a speed button that makes players run at an extreme
    and somewhat unrealistic speed. It is not entirely an advantage as using it
    widens the gap between the ball and the foot, leaving players wide open for
    tackles. Unlike similar games, there also isn't a way to scroll through the
    available players - the game automatically selects the player nearest to the
    ball.
    .
    The camera is dynamic and smoothly zooms in and out to give the best overview of
    the pitch. Multiplayer is available for up to four players through multitap. It
    was released in June of 1998 to coincide with the 1998 World Cup played in
    France at that time.

  description:
    The time for resurrecting historical events has come. Panzer General was one of
    the first games (if not the first) that actually gave you the ability to play
    for the Nazis, and yet succeed where Hitler failed. Having total and complete
    control over land, sea and air units, you must defeat the Allied dogs as fast as
    you can (to get a major victory), or slower than in history (to get the minor
    victory).
    .
    The game's quality lies in the quantity of units. There are basically hundreds
    of Axis and Allied units from World War II, accompanied with "circled"
    animations and battle sounds, as well as marching or moving sounds. The Main
    menu is always located on the right side of the screen, with plenty of options
    and selections you can change to suit your preferences.
    .
    A turn-based hexagon strategy game that will actually go faster if you have
    faster computer, but will always be playable (speed doesn't go up infinite). The
    first and original Panzer General, this installment would be followed by sequels
    and many other games in the series using the "General" name.

    rooms. Defeating an enemy can also grant the player new body parts as well as
    experience and skill points. The player can move around his robot from a third
    person perspective and launch different attacks such as jabs, straight, hook and
    upper attacks. With good timing it's also possible to link attacks together. A
    special attack can be executed when the SP gauge is full. There's also a guard
    impact command which allows the player to repel the enemy attack. The player has
    a booster which allows the robot to fly as long as the boost gauge lasts. A
    battle ends when one of the combatants has his energy reduced to zero.

    beforehand to behave in a certain way under certain conditions using a flow
    diagram system.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    The game also features a fairly complex negotiation system that allows the
    player to purchase, research, or upgrade new equipment and parts. The OKEs
    themselves can be upgraded as well through this system, allowing for extended
    use of the same model for as long as possible. The various companies involved in
    the negotiation process can also provide valuable information about the
    purchases of the enemy, allowing the player to better plan for the next
    advancement in enemy technology.

    A girl named Kukuru lives in a village controlled by the Sacred Tribe - people
    who guard an ancient flame which contains a powerful spirit that was sealed in
    it many years ago. Kukuru must marry a man she doesn't love, and in order to
    avoid this marriage, she accepts the offer of the mayor: he asks her to
    extinguish the flame. As a result, the spirit awakes and threatens to destroy
    the world. A young adventurer named Arc arrives to the village at the same
    moment as Kukuru is standing frightened in front of the spirit. Arc immediately
    recognizes it - it was the murderer of his father! Before he realizes how that
    could be possible, the spirit disappears, and now Arc and Kukuru have to do
    everything in their powers to undo the error, to stop the spirit, and perhaps to
    avenge the death of Arc's father.
    .
    "Arc the Lad" is a hybrid of traditional and strategy-based console-style RPGs.
    The story unfolds as you are transported from location to location and enter
    battles - you don't walk around on the world map, choosing yourself which
    location to visit. The battles take place on a battle field, on which you can
    move and attack only when you approach the opponent.

  game: Tobal No. 1
  file: Tobal No. 1 (USA).zip
  developer: Squaresoft
  publisher: Squaresoft
  description:
    Tobal No. 1 is a fighting game for the PlayStation developed by DreamFactory and
    published by Square in 1996. The game was DreamFactory's first release, as well
    as Square's first release on the CD-based console.\n
    Tobal No. 1 marks Square's incursion into the fighting game genre, although an
    adventure-like quest mode is part of the game. The game's mechanics were
    designed with the aid of fighter game designer Seiichi Ishii, while all the
    characters were designed by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame. The sequel,
    Tobal 2, was never released in North America and Europe.\n
    Packaged with both the North American and Japanese version of the game was a
    sampler disc featuring a pre-release demo of Final Fantasy VII and video
    previews of Final Fantasy Tactics, Bushido Blade, and SaGa Frontier.\n
    STORY:\n
    Tobal No. 1 takes place in the year 2027 on a fictional planet called Tobal,
    which has large deposits of Molmoran, an ore that can be used as an energy
    source. The planet's 98th tournament is held to determine who has the rights to
    the ore. A number of humans and aliens compete for the title. The game's plot
    and character backstories are only explored in the instruction manual. All of
    the initial eight playable characters receive the same ending.\n
    The game's immediately playable characters include Chuji Wu, Oliems, Epon, Hom,
    Fei Pusu, Mary Ivonskaya, Ill Goga, and Gren Kutz. Bosses include Nork, Mufu,
    and the emperor Udan. All bosses are unlockable after defeating them in Dungeon
    Mode except Nork. Instead, the game allows the player to select Snork (Small
    Nork), a pint-sized version of the very large character. There is also one
    secret fighter named Toriyama Robo (named for Akira Toriyama) who is unlockable
    if the player can complete the 30-floor Udan's Dungeon level in the quest mode.
    Toriyama Robo is not seen at any point in the game except at the very end of the
    dungeon.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    Tobal No. 1 has various gameplay modes including a tournament mode, two player
    versus mode, practice mode, and the unique quest mode, all of which utilize the
    same fighting system. The game itself runs at up to a smooth 60 frames per
    second due to its lack of textured polygons and reduced details which gave the
    game a distinctive look in comparison to other fighting games at the time, such
    as Tekken 2. The game's controls are unique in that they allow full freedom of
    movement in the ring as long as the player faces the opponent. The player has
    the ability to dash and jump, and certain buttons execute high, medium, and low
    attacks for each character. Tobal No. 1 also has an intuitive grappling and
    blocking system, offering the player a variety of throws and counter moves.\n
    Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Tobal No. 1 is the "Quest Mode", which
    combines the game's fighting controls with three-dimensional dungeon
    exploration. The player must advance down a number of floors, contend with
    traps, and engage in fights with a variety of enemies including the game's
    playable characters. Several items can be found, dropped by enemies, or bought
    using crystals. These items can be picked up, consumed, or thrown at enemies,
    and include foodstuffs that can restore the player's HP or potions that have a
    range of effects including raising the player's maximum health or bringing it
    down to 1 point. There is no way to save one's progress, and dying means
    starting over from the beginning. Defeating certain characters in this mode
    unlocks them as playable characters in the game's other modes.\n
    Each of the eight initially playable characters can perform high, medium, and
    low attacks, and the game makes use of a grappling and blocking system that lets
    players execute a variety of throws and counterattacks.\n
    Features:\n
    Featuring such modes of play as "Tournament," "Vs.," and "Quest"\n
    Kick, punch, guard, jump, dash, and attack your way through the darkness of a
    dungeon to locate the Molmoran\n
    Select from 11 different characters including Emperor Udan, Nork, Hom, Epon, and
    Oliems

    Introducing Lammy, a totally rockin' guitarist.  In day-to-day life, she's quite
    timid, shy, and wimpy - but put a guitar in her hands, and she'll blow you away!
    Help Lammy get to her latest gig on time, and face obstacles such as flaming
    buildings, out-of-control airplanes, and even getting trapped in Hell.
    .
    In this sequel to PaRappa The Rapper you play as Lammy, a guitarist for MilkCan
    - the coolest, hippest band ever!  While PaRappa focused on lyrics, with each
    button controlling a different word; Lammy is a guitar player, so naturally,
    each button controls a different note on the guitar.  Lammy will encounter seven
    different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons
    accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe.
    The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better
    performance.
    .
    Lammy improves over PaRappa in a multitude of ways.  Rather than just being a
    single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend.  Any stages
    that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively.  If you
    don't have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer
    to take on the role of your partner.  After finishing the initial game, PaRappa
    also makes a return, allowing you to play through the game again with raps
    instead of Lammy's guitar.

  developer: Mud Duck

  description:
    Defend a castle against attacks while laying siege to the enemy with well-placed
    projectiles in this PS port of the German PC game. A mix of traditional
    real-time strategy and action puzzle-solving, the basic concept of Ballerburg:
    Cannons Catapults may remind some older gamers of the early-'90s classic
    Rampart. The game's story, told tongue-in-cheek, casts players as generals, in
    charge of the queen's military and based in her castle. War is waged over long
    distances, with classic siege weapons and powerful magic.\n
    The queen's two sisters each have their own armies and fortifications, and the
    battle will not be finished until only one castle is left standing. As the game
    progresses, castles collect tax revenue. Generals can use these funds to add new
    armaments, placing them where they'll do the most damage to the enemy, and also
    build additional defenses and repair damage that has already been done. Players
    are ranked according to their performances and may even earn a medal if they are
    especially successful on the battlefield.\n
    Playing like Worms in 3D, or Worms 3D if you like, the idea is to raze your
    opponent?s castle to the ground through the use of cannons and catapults. These
    must to be aimed manually while taking wind speeds into consideration, and also
    need a few seconds to reload at which point both yourself and your enemy are
    vulnerable. New arsenal can be researched, including triple catapults, while
    later zeppelins and magic attacks such as thunderstorms become available.
    There?s a little bit of resource management to take into account as well, with
    various buildings available to rake in the gold.

    springs, and trample the opponents with sheep in the red-rock canyons, get

    horse in the Opera stage to come in and trounce on the enemies. Even Gossamer,

    As the sequel to 1997's #1 selling football game for the Sony PlayStation, NFL
    GameDay 99 offers several new features designed to improve the gameplay as well
    as the presentation. First off, the 3D graphics have returned but with double
    the amount of polygons--bringing the total close to 350 per player. The
    animations have also improved to deliver one-handed spinning catches, lunges and
    off-balanced throws. A new zooming camera system will bring you closer to the
    on-field action, with player photos and statistical updates during the game.\n
    For the first time in the GameDay series, NBC announcers Dick Enberg and Phil
    Simms will provide the play-by-play and color commentary, respectively. Over 500
    plays have been included along with thirty NFL teams and 1,500 players with
    ratings based on the 1998 season. The artificial intelligence has been refined
    to accurately model real-life defenses, with defensive backs backpedaling and
    shifting based on the player's offensive formations.\n
    NFL GameDay 99 also offers the following: the ability to create, draft, sign,
    trade or release players and free agents; four difficulty levels; three game
    styles (Arcade, Simulation and Total Control); multiple weather conditions;

    The official video game of the Games of the XXVII Olympiad held in 2000 in
    Sydney. It includes 32 nations, going for gold in 12 events divided by 6 sports:
    Athletics (100m dash, 110m hurdles, hammer and javelin throw, triple jump and
    high jump), Aquatics (200m freestyle and 10m platform diving), Kayak K1 Slalom,
    Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting, Skeet Shooting and Three-man track cycling
    pursuit. All events feature 3D graphics with cameras that mimic the ones used in
    TV broadcasts.

    buttons is required in most events to build up strength/speed, with an
    additional third button setting the actions, such as jumping or throwing angle.
    Other events feature alternate control methods, such as Slalom (where it's
    possible to press certain buttons to dodge the rower between the gates if the
    Kayak is going to hit one or place the paddle to force into a certain
    direction),  Diving (following a "click-along" sequence of keys) and Skeet (the
    direction keys controlling the aim, one button to start and other to shoot).
    .
    Along an arcade and 8-player action, the Olympic mode gives the player the
    option to build their athlete from the national open trials to the Olympics. By
    completing training drills in the Cyber Gym, the athlete increases his athletic
    abilities: Citius, Altius, Fortius, as told by the Olympic Motto. Before joining

    topped by a turret called "The Citadel" appears on a nearby spot. The player can
    enter it by pressing both L1 and R1 buttons, assuming the role of the turret
    operator. Besides handling the weapons, the player can access the build menu,
    from where unit factories can be erected on the surrounding terrain. Extra
    turrets can also be placed around the perimeter to protect the base. The
    structures can be recycled to be replaced with new ones.

    The tank is equipped with several weapons, from laser beams to guided missiles,
    that can be used against enemy troops. From the inside, friendly units can be
    summoned when available to fight alongside in battle. Infantry, tanks and
    aircraft can be called into action from the interface menu. A tactical map
    showing an overhead view of the terrain can be activated with the select button.

    siege. The first two have the players fighting directly against each other,
    while the last one is more strategic, where the objective is to defend the base
    from incoming enemy assaults.

    Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this

    graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.
    .
    You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply
    go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the
    occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different
    background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In
    addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode;
    indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets;
    crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby
    space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty
    of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers,
    Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

    standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and
    hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat,
    Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.
    .
    The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is
    to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot
    directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....
    .
    Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone,

    Maximum Force is a lightgun game for one or two players. As top
    counter-terrorism agents, you and a partner have three missions to complete to
    eradicate the world of a band of evil terrorists.\n
    Each mission set in radically different locations and is divided into three
    stages. After each stage you and your partner are rated in terms of accuracy,
    number of kills, number of streaks (consecutive hits), total shots fired, amount
    of damage done, and your total score. The third mission can be played only when
    the first two have been completed.\n
    Per standard shooting games, you must try to kill the terrorists and spare the
    innocents. There are power-ups to shoot that will increase your firepower to
    shotgun or machine gun level.\n
    Not standard to many shooting games however is the encouragement the Maximum
    Force presents to do physical damage to your surroundings. Most everything in
    the game is shootable and will show damage when shot. Windows may be shot out,
    flower pots shatter, etc. Hitting certain items will start mini-games within the
    game, such as a duck-shooting gallery or a shark hunt. These mini-games serve to
    increase your score.\n
    The look of the game is somewhat reminiscent of Lethal Enforcers, except the
    camera is much more fluid. You will frequently change camera positionsand find
    yourself shooting at targets on the fly. An almost identical game to Maximum
    Force in terms of look and game play is Area 51.

    reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are collapsing around
    you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other
    craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your
    weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters.
    .
    On the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo
    64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation
    version has no multiplayer options.

  developer: Sony

  description:
    "Wild Arms 2" isn't really a sequel to Sony's original title. Your hero, a young
    soldier Ashley, is transformed to a demon. Ashley is determined to purge the
    evil from his body. He meets Brad, a criminal and a war-hero, and Lilka, a
    female magician. Together, they start a journey in order to discover the unknown
    foes which have corrupted Ashley, but soon they find out that a much greater
    conspiracy has taken place...
    .
    The combat system in "Wild Arms" is very similar to the one in Final Fantasy
    games: turned-based attacks, and a menu choice of physical attacks, spells, and
    even Guardians, which are more or less the same like the Guardian Forces in
    "Final Fantasy VIII". The "Arms" are special abilities which the party members
    learn while progressing in the game.
    .
    "Wild Arms 2" also has many adventure elements, which links it to Nintendo's
    Zelda games. The dungeons (which can - and must - be viewed rotating the camera)
    contain many puzzles to solve.

    In the near future, mankind's tinkering with the science of genetics and the
    developmental process of genome mapping has resulted in the accidental creation
    of a new disease known as EINDS. This disease, which attacks a cell's DNA and
    halts mitosis and meiosis (the processes that allow our cells to duplicate), has
    killed nearly a billion people and no hope of a cure has been discovered.\n
    With the disease spreading rapidly, it is feared that the manipulations of DNA
    will lead to mankind's complete undoing. It's up to three mercenaries and a
    mysterious woman with no past to combine their separate efforts into one
    adventure involving danger, intrigue, and supernatural involvement, with the
    prize perhaps being salvation for human kind.\n
    Fear Effect: Retro Helix is a cinematic adventure game for the PlayStation.
    Although it has been released after the original Fear Effect title, it is in
    actuality a prequel to the events in the first game, explaining how Hana
    Tsu-Vachel, Royce Glas, and Jacob Decourt wound up together. The game takes

    soul.\n
    The gist of the gameplay consists of moving about a series of static screens,
    collecting items and objects for later use, and solving puzzles in order to
    progress further into the game. An onscreen compass allows players to determine
    in which cardinal direction they're able to proceed. Movement between these
    screens is facilitated by pressing the appropriate direction on the D-pad. If
    the scene contains any interactive elements, a cursor is displayed that can be
    moved about the environment, allowing players to investigate or manipulate
    whatever they are.\n
    Exploring the recesses of Sarah's mind, players find themselves confronted with
    a variety of surreal, often disturbing images. The puzzles, too, are out of the
    ordinary, requiring players to find a corporeal entity for their spiritual
    essence so they may interact with objects; utilizing color and music to solve
    puzzles and the like. The title presents a host of puzzles that range in
    difficulty and scope, some requiring the use of acquired implements, while
    others demand logic.\n
    The most important item in your possession is the pendant from your
    girlfriend.You can use this at any time to save your game.\n
    Features:\n
    * Save your girlfriend Sarah from the Great Evil that possesses her\n
    * Acquire items that may be used to aid you in your quest\n
    * Solve an array of puzzles to advance further into the title

    As Ford automobiles have won the NASCAR Winston Cup trophy more often than cars
    from any other manufacturer, it seems natural to create a game based on this
    consistent success. Empire Interactive has done just that in Ford Racing. In
    addition to the classic Taurus or Mustang, players may also choose to race a
    GT90, an Explorer, an F-Series, or one of several concept cars. In all, twelve
    different vehicles are available to players in Ford Racing.\n
    The game features ten racetracks and a couple of different modes of play.
    Single-player and multiplayer races are available, as well as a career mode.
    Career mode allows players to race for sponsors, improving their vehicles with a
    share of the prize money. With continued success and sufficient winnings,
    players may eventually build up enough of a financial base to sponsor their own
    racing teams and compete at the world-class level.

  developer: Sony
  publisher: Sony
  description:
    Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers
    were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was
    the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies.
    Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent
    uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this,
    the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses,
    which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun
    as the past and future are about to collide...\n
    In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll
    travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well
    as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at
    once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference
    being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the
    souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and
    even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.\n
    Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a
    fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the
    party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known
    as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's
    ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an
    attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you
    press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center
    rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more
    hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.\n
    Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind,
    earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an
    enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another
    unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It
    allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button
    appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of
    the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small
    amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not
    properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a
    result.\n
    Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows,
    axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other
    items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to
    enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins
    with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in
    chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the
    in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors.
    There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle,
    found in chests, or purchased from merchants.\n
    Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to
    avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run
    into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you
    find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks
    of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and
    vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.

    The amazing adventurer Lara Croft returns once again with the third release in
    the Tomb Raider series for the PlayStation, Tomb Raider III: The Adventures of
    Lara Croft. This time she has some new moves such as crawl, monkey swing, and
    speed dash to help her through tough situations.\n
    The story unfolds with some background on the current situation. In years past,
    British sailors discovered a meteor buried deep in the Earth. Unwittingly, they
    looted four artifacts found with the meteor. One of these sailors kept a journal
    as they headed back to England -- he was the only one to make it home alive.\n
    With that in mind, the game begins with several key elements falling into place
    that will eventually reunite the lost artifacts. Lara is in India searching for
    one of these precious items, unaware of its true history. She only knows that
    local beliefs state that the artifact was to contain great powers.\n
    It is up to you as Lara to use what little information you have at hand to begin
    your quest in finding the artifacts, and discovering their power.\n
    Tomb Raider III's graphics have been updated from the previous titles with a
    faster engine. Such improvements include more texture palettes for finer detail,
    improved water and reflection effects, smoother surfaces and real-time lighting
    effects.\n
    The story and gameplay are designed to unfold in a non-linear fashion, as in
    Lara's previous adventures, but even more so. This time gamers will be able to
    choose their own destiny by selecting the order in which they play each of the
    four main levels. The levels are also more open, with multiple routes to the
    same end. You may also choose to replay each level so you can avoid missing any
    part of the adventure.

    The third entry in the Jet Moto series once again places you in the driving seat
    of a futuristic hoverbike, racing at breakneck speed in a truly extreme sport.
    While a Jet Moto hoverbike might look like a jet ski, it is capable of far more:
    it travels across land as well as water and can use a magnetic grapple to make
    extremely tight turns. During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge
    obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won't hesitate to bump you
    into a tree or maybe even knock you off a cliff.
    .
    Jet Moto 3 offers ten different riders and 19 tracks across the wide open ocean,
    over mountainous terrain, and through cityscapes. As with the earlier games, two
    people can still race in a split-screen mode.

    compete for cash and prizes. Games can be customized to last 15 minutes, 10
    minutes, 20 minutes, or between three to five rounds. A new twist comes in the
    form of the Solo Game, which allows you the chance to play without other
    contestants stealing your thunder.\n
    The catch is that you only have eight turns before the game ends. For every
    incorrect guess, bankrupt or lose-a-turn space you land on, you're forced to use
    one of your remaining free spins.\n
    Over 2,000 puzzles designed by the show's writers are included, but you don't
    have to worry about them repeating if you have a memory card; the game will keep
    track of your progress as well as the top five scores for each different mode
    you play.\n
    Wheel of Fortune also features high-resolution graphics, vibration feedback
    while spinning the wheel, and digitized pictures of the various prizes (such as
    hang gliders or paddle boats) if you're lucky enough to land on the space. Other
    options include choosing set locations, the amount of videos displayed (normal
    or minimal), the timer speed (normal, fast or slow) and volume levels of both
    sound and video.\n

  description:
    1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the
    end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world
    of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of
    Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a
    lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his
    position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift",
    the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that
    Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of
    range and banishes him into the Abyss.  There, Raziel is lost in time, died and
    his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken
    body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld.
    Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's
    underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...
    .
    Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his
    quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers,
    leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's
    shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using
    specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings
    allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material"
    world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in
    order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which
    give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains
    Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is
    recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to
    defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark
    gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file
    telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can
    arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes,
    as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come
    across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create
    a powerful energy blade weapon.
    .
    The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed
    and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however
    sometimes  requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles
    the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the
    placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to
    activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.

    that encourages the player to collect as much as possible.  Make sure you have a
    Memory card available before starting out on Pac-Man's lengthy quest!
    .
    The other two types of modes are Classic mode and Maze mode.  Classic mode is a
    100% faithful conversion of Pac-Man's original game.  Maze Mode is the gameplay
    from Classic Pac-Man translated into a 3D environment.  All the Pac-Pellets,
    Ghosts, Walls, and Pac-Man are displayed in very pleasing 3D.

    system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. In contrast to other
    32-bit era Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy Tactics uses a 3D, isometric,
    rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters.

    bombs, jokers), each with a special power. Extras become steadily available as
    higher levels are attained, with the most powerful Flash Triangle marble
    (changes all marbles in a triangle to the same type) appearing at level 36. A
    special set of marbles is available exclusively for the arcade mode. See-saws,
    cranes, trios, combinations, closed circles, and more offer a myriad of gameplay

    Why do people hate? What causes such intense animosity that a person would go to
    any length to hurt someone, perhaps even destroy them? These are just a few
    questions posed by the relationship of Jax and Kano.\n
    Is it because Jax is a Special Forces agent and must bring Kano to justice?
    Could it be that simple? Would it justify following him to another realm and
    becoming involved in the Mortal Kombat competition? Can hate make you so blind
    that you'd face demons in hopes of facing the one man you truly want to
    destroy?\n
    Greater yet is the mystery of how Kano became involved with Shang Tsung and the
    significance of the Black Dragon. So many questions left unanswered, so many
    things seemingly left to chance. At least until now...\n
    In Mortal Kombat Special Forces by Midway, you play as Jax. Your mission is to
    destroy Kano and his army of thugs, but it won't be easy. You have to explore 3D
    environments from a third-person perspective and find hidden areas. Punch, kick,
    and shoot your way through the droves of enemies you'll face. Watch out for
    thugs armed with guns and other weapons trying to snuff out your life before you
    can get to your true objective.\n
    Be sure to pay close attention to incoming messages. They will give hints and
    help you solve the riddle of hate. They may even lead you to some secret places
    too. Collect items and weapons in order to increase your firepower and fill your
    health meter -- there is even a sniper rifle for some long distance attacks.
    Amass experience points and learn new and devastating combo moves. Pull off one
    of those combos at the right time, and witness a gruesome fatality.\n

  game: The Legend of Dragoon

  developer: Sony

  description:
    Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers
    were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was
    the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies.
    Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent
    uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this,
    the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses,
    which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun
    as the past and future are about to collide...\n
    In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll
    travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well
    as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at
    once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference
    being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the
    souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and
    even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.\n
    Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a
    fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the
    party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known
    as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's
    ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an
    attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you
    press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center
    rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more
    hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.\n
    Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind,
    earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an
    enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another
    unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It
    allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button
    appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of
    the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small
    amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not
    properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a
    result.\n
    Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows,
    axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other
    items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to
    enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins
    with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in
    chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the
    in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors.
    There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle,
    found in chests, or purchased from merchants.\n
    Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to
    avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run
    into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you
    find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks
    of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and
    vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.

    In the quiet country of Tradguld, there are many sleepy little towns. Langoud
    rests on the coast, Sharan is the floating city where most of the trade and
    business is done, and Myscatonia is clouded in mystery and wonder. Each city has
    nothing in common with the other except for the fact they share the same
    country. That is until the Dianova sets their sights on them. Dianova is a dark
    evil empire bent on conquering the world through swords and magic.\n
    PLOT:\n
    Meis Triumph lives in the nature-rich town of Kant deep within the countryside
    of Tradguld. He has no worries and lives with his loving family who happens to
    be powerful Spirit Blacksmiths. Then the Dianova brought their war-machine
    crashing down on his quiet life. Everyone was forced to flee in terror and Meis
    became separated from the family he loved. He fled to Boyzby where he vows to
    free his people from the terror and oppression of the Dianovan Empire and where
    he meets the beautiful Sodina. Now the adventure truly begins.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    Thousand Arms by Atlus is an RPG with a faceted story and intricate gameplay. As
    in all RPGs, it has a turn-based combat system but only the character in the
    fist position may attack. The other two members of your party are used for
    defensive back-up.\n
    You play as Meis Triumph, heir to the Triumphs, a family of Spirit Blacksmiths.
    You can add two other members to the war party. You must travel the world and
    talk to people in the cities and towns to get valuable allies and information
    that will aid you on your quest. Stop in the village shops to get new armor,
    weapons and other items to truly make your band of heroes unstoppable.\n
    You also have to go on dates as all great heroes do. Rather than seeking love,
    these dates have another purpose. Keep your date happy and you can get special
    weapons, information and new abilities. So be sure to be a gentleman and always
    pay attention to what must be done in the mini-games to win her over!\n
    As a Spirit Blacksmith you have the ability to make weapons better by increasing
    their attack and defensive power as well as adding new features and spells. Of
    course, along the way you must battle enemies, explore dungeons and perform
    mini-quests in order to achieve your ultimate goal: the destruction of the
    Dianovan Empire and the evil Mecha.\n
    Are you hero enough to save your people? Are you suave enough to be a great
    date? Do you have the emotional and spiritual power to be a truly powerful
    Spirit Blacksmith? Pray you do; your entire race is depending on you.\n
    CHARACTERS:\n
    - Meis Triumph- (16-years-old) The heir to a family of Spirit Blacksmiths, Meis
    learned to be a womanizer from his father. Stubborn and lazy, Meis is forced to
    change his ways against his will, first when the Dark Acolytes force him to
    leave his comfortable home, and then when the spirits of the Ancient Blacksmiths
    give him the mission of finding the sacred flames. He is attracted to Sodina,
    but can't resist hitting on other beautiful women.\n
    In addition to his ability to reforge weapons to increase their power and grant
    them magical spells or special attacks, Meis can obtain "Elemental Beasts" to
    use in combat, similar to the "summons" seen in the Final Fantasy games. His
    weapon is a sword.\n
    - Sodina Dawnfried- (15-years-old) The younger sister of a great Spirit
    Blacksmith named Jyabil, Sodina is a beautiful, red-haired girl; however, she's
    also very brave. After her brother is killed by the Dark Acolytes, she decides
    to help Meis on his quest. She has feelings for Meis but finds herself often
    enraged by his lecherous behaviour. Her weapon of choice is a dagger.\n
    - Muza Grifford- (21-years-old) A knight and an old friend of Meis, he's brave
    but not too clever, and tended to freeze when in the presence of pretty girls.
    He has a very large physique. He develops feelings for Wyna. His weapon is a
    claymore, a huge sword that normal people would have a difficult time
    wielding.\n
    - Wyna Grapple- (17-years-old) The daughter of the King of the Pirates, Wyna is
    a boisterous girl who loves fighting; she joins the party just to go on
    adventures. She wears a bikini as well as an eyepatch, but just for effect,
    she's not missing any eyes. If you pay attention during dates, you'll see that
    Wyna's eyepatch changes eyes from time to time. At first she's attracted to Meis
    because of his strength, but later returns Muza's feelings. Wyna's weapon is a
    large battle hammer.\n
    - Nelsha Stylus- (Appears to be 16-years-old) A unique girl whose personality
    changes when she puts on new outfits, due to the spirits that inhabit them.
    Nelsha is a shy, nerdy-looking girl who speaks of herself in the third person.
    She dreams of becoming a "Dress Master", a title given to the best clothes
    designers in the world (similar to Metalia's title of Jewel Master). Her weapon
    is a magic sewing needle.\n
    In addition, Nelsha can change her costumes in combat, which changes her form
    completely and gives her different powers.\n
    - Kyleen Nelphe- (16-years-old) A green-haired female thief who tries to use the
    party for her own purposes, but ends up befriending and joining them. Her
    personality is cynical and sarcastic. She seems attracted to Soushi. Her weapon
    is a rapier, a sword used for fencing.\n
    - Soushi Maharoba- (18-years-old) A samurai with a lot of pride, who considers
    himself a ladykiller as well. His most notable feature is his pink kimono (a
    garment not usually worn by males). He and Meis can't stand each other at first
    but eventually come to respect each other. His weapon is a katana called
    Masamune (a popular name given to katanas in RPGs, named after the blacksmith
    from feudal Japan).

  game: Pitball

  developer: Sony
  publisher: Sony
  description:
    Set in the 23rd century, Pitball is the only sport left in existence. There are
    no rules in this violent battle -- your objective is simply to score as many
    goals as possible while destroying the other team.\n
    Before jumping into the action, you'll select from one of twelve available
    teams. Consisting of two players per roster, teams include human beings and
    various alien races, each with their own distinctive forms of attack. While the
    Arquons utilize a series of oceanic attacks, the stone creatures of the
    Slorillians use volcanic rock to decimate their opponents.\n
    In this brutal sport, the idea is to smash up the other team in an attempt to
    make them drop the ball; the ball is made of pure energy. To help your team
    become stronger, you can purchase items and free agents. Money is gained from
    bank loans, team sponsors and by placing bets on games. While on the playing
    field, your team can obtain special power-up items that increase power,
    revitalize hit points, shield players from attacks and grant other mysterious
    effects.\n
    Pitball includes several gameplay options including Training, Single Game and
    Season modes. The Training mode is specifically designed for novice players and
    newcomers. Played on a holographic field, it teaches you the basics of gameplay.
    Whereas the Single Game is simply an exhibition match, the Season is a furious
    battle to the championship. There are also multi-player options including
    competitions for two, three and four players and a cooperative Versus mode. When
    more than two people are going to play, however, a Multi-Tap is needed.

  description:
    Trouble in Mega-City One: An unidentified perpetrator has taken hostages,
    including the mayor. Attempts to apprehend him have already lead to the loss of
    17 Judges. He states that only one man is allowed to come near: Judge Dredd.
    There's obviously some history between them. It's time for the toughest lawman
    of them all to move in and dispense justice via his Lawgiver gun.
    .
    Judge Dredd for the PlayStation is an 'on rails' lightgun shooter based on the
    original comics instead of the 1995 movie. The action moves through pre-rendered
    environments on a fixed path. 14 levels spread over 4 stages must be cleared of
    lawbreakers.
    .
    Most enemies are polygonal 3D models overlaid over the video backdrop, but the
    background can also be shot at: gun turrets and some bosses like hovertanks and
    other heavy machinery are pre-rendered objects. Powerups are hidden in the
    scenery as well: there are different ammunition types for the Lawgiver,
    including rapid fire and heat-seekers. Also available are medikits, extra lives
    and rockets which can clear the screen of enemies.
    .
    Not everything on the screen should be shot at, however: sometimes, innocent
    citizens will cross the scene. Hitting too many of them means a quick 'game
    over'.
    .
    The storyline of the game is told between levels via live-action cutscenes.

  description:
    After creating a massive world with vast oceans, landscapes and an infinite
    universe, God instituted human beings to keep his creation in order. Upon
    realization that man was mortally flawed with weaknesses and feelings, he
    created a mysterious force known as the Seru; these stone objects would aid
    humans in decisions and day to day functions. Worn as an apparel item, they
    granted the wearer many strengths and abilities ranging from the movement of
    heavy objects to flying capabilities. Thus, human life was made easier -- the
    Seru would forever obey their masters.\n
    And then the Mist arrived.\n
    Filled with destructive means and hatred, the Mist covered the human's
    cultivated lands and destroyed a seemingly eternal bond with the Seru. Instead
    of loyally helping their masters, the mysterious stones turned against the
    humans; they became maniacal tools of evil, controlling minds and ruining
    innocent lives. The human existence was reduced tremendously with few survivors
    fleeing to uncharted territories. Perhaps the Mist wouldn't find them wherever
    they ran.

    Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented
    as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show
    appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive
    deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade
    troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.\n
    As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped
    Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired
    cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist
    organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives
    intact.\n
    Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother
    and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large
    metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time.
    An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert
    Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of
    the crusade.\n
    Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to
    overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas
    of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to
    create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages,
    the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she
    would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.\n
    But what are the queen's true intentions?

  description:
    Conrad may have thought he escaped from the alien Morphs, but he thought wrong.
    After fighting his way through their world the first time, in a game called
    Flashback, he went into a cryogenic sleep aboard his little space vessel. For 50
    years he drifted aimlessly in space, waiting to be found. The good news is that
    Conrad was found and beamed up on an alien ship; the bad news is that the alien
    race that found him is none other than his enemy: the Morphs. Once again, he
    must escape from their hostile world and regain his freedom that he had fought
    so hard for.\n
    Fade To Black is a sequel to the 2D classic Flashback. It picks up 50 years
    after the latter did, and uses the same character. Where this sequel differs is
    that it features 3D graphics in a 3D world, allowing players to immerse
    themselves even more in Conrad's struggle for freedom. The game features over 13
    levels filled with intricate puzzles, sub-levels and missions, highly detailed
    textures and graphics, lots of items to interact with and a good amount of
    action.\n
    Features:\n
    # 13 levels\n
    # A variety of sublevels and challenging puzzles\n
    # Detailed 3D rendered characters\n

    Officially licensed and endorsed by the National Basketball Association, NBA
    Live 96 features all 29 NBA teams in addition to two All Star teams and over 300
    real players and rosters based on the 1995 season. Additionally, each team's
    home courts have been faithfully represented with realistic detailing.\n
    NBA Live 96 features a wealth of gameplay options including the setting up of
    actual defensive and offensive patterns, trading players, and setting your own
    player rosters. If you've elected to play a Season (either shortened or full),
    you'll be required to meet roster and trade deadlines in addition to leading
    your team to victory. Players can choose from box and inside triangle offensive
    strategies to defensive full court presses and half court traps.\n
    The Season mode features actual statistic tracking and a full team schedule of
    games. If you've ever felt like your favorite player doesn't get enough
    attention, here's your chance to make him shine! Statistics are based on
    rebounds, assists, points-per-game, etc. Be careful, though -- overplaying the
    same people over and over again can result in serious injuries.\n
    Additionally, players can select a Playoffs mode or a single game of basketball.
    The Playoffs save you the time and hassle of going through an NBA season; just
    pick your favorite team and play hard for the championship! Single games of
    basketball can be played with anywhere between one and eight players (a
    Multi-Tap device is needed for anything other than two-players).\n
    NBA Live 96 features SGI rendered courts and player models with realistic alley
    oops, dunks, dribbles, and Virtual Stadium technology. There are also multiple
    camera views that pan from basket to basket or hover above the action with a
    television-styled presentation.

    Tecmo expands its Monster Rancher line with Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout for the
    PlayStation. This game is a fast-paced platform jumper in which players race
    their bouncing characters through extraordinary obstacle courses. Along the way
    there are several panels which can provide all sorts of power-ups to the
    characters that find them.\n
    The game features a versus mode, in which two players can race side by side
    through the same course. To provide further replay value, the game also comes
    with a level editor that allows players to design their own Monster Rancher
    courses.\n
    When a player steers a monster in a certain direction, it will continue moving
    in that direction instead of straightening its path or stopping. To change the
    speed and height of their jumps, players must land on special squares. Only the
    controller's directional pad is used during the game, no buttons.\n
    Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout becomes challenging quickly, especially after the
    first ten rounds. There are generally multiple ways to complete each round, some
    of which are noticeably easier. At first the special squares that propel players
    forward earn them additional time and so forth are helpful in raising scores and
    adding to the game's enjoyment, but by level 16 it's necessary to hit them just
    to clear levels.\n
    Features:\n
    * Over 50 challenging stages riddled with obstacle courses\n
    * Choose from a number of Monster Rancher characters including Hare, Golem, and
    Mocchi\n

    Movement and interaction are facilitated by a context-sensitive cursor, through

    Based on the premise that aliens who originally settled Earth have returned (and
    they're not happy about the proliferation of the human race, go figure), Xevious
    3-D/G+ is a 3-D remake of the original Namco classic Xevious (licensed to Atari

    The new game sticks to the basic concepts of the original Xevious, right down to
    the familiar overhead view. Power-ups offer new weapons such as constant-fire,
    electrocution beams and wide-dispersal lasers --- but along with new weapons
    come new enemies and new bosses who aren't quite so easy to eliminate.\n
    Included as a bonus are the original Xevious, emulated to perfection (a nice
    addition since the only other PlayStation version available is on the rather
    hard-to-find Namco Museum Volume 2), and the only console version available of
    Xevious Arrangement, a more obscure coin-up conversion designed to vex those who

    developer Yuke's Co., Ltd, who produces the Toukon Retsuden series, and told
    them to make a game worthy of The Rock. WWF SmackDown! was the result of this
    collaboration.\n
    Based on the prime time UPN WWF television show that made its debut in September
    of 1999, WWF SmackDown! tries to capture all elements of the typical WWF
    broadcast. While all the usual mayhem involved within the ring is present,
    including a Season mode, I Quit matches, Falls Count Anywhere and the like, the
    game takes a more global approach to the WWF as it also offers a story mode. Now
    you'll be able to directly experience the backstage drama that is an integral
    part of a WWF broadcast. You'll develop rivalries, make allies and try to defend
    your best interests.\n
    You'll be get the chance to play as over 30 of the top WWF superstars from the
    year 2000. Your superstar of choice will be able to make a bold entrance thanks
    to the authentic Titantron footage that plays before the wrestler makes their
    entrance. The attitude will be thick in the arena after a win thanks to the
    authentic post-match victory poses and exit themes. You'll also get to create
    your own wrestlers with the Create a Wrestler Mode, and unlock hidden
    personalities and wrestlers during extended Season mode play.\n
    Players will also get a variety of arenas and backstage areas to face off in as
    they enter the Smackdown Hotel. You'll be able to feel the electricity as you
    throw your opponent up the ramp and drag his pathetic carcass off to the
    kitchen, the parking lot, or even the boiler room.\n
    So know your role and get ready to bow down to the masters. The people's game
    has arrived, so get ready to "layeth the smacketh down" on the entire WWF roster
    present in the game. To be in the game, you have to beat the game.\n
    Features:\n
    - Play through the story and make decisions that alter the story, tag teams and

    Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars
    and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young
    Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners
    don't suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very

    dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they'll have to confront
    Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan...
    .
    The gameplay of "Fear Effect" is based on survival horror titles à la  Resident
    Evil, but it also features many pure action elements and arcade-like sequences,
    where precise timing matters. You can crouch, sneak on your enemies, and roll
    forward or to the sides. There are many human as well as monster enemies to
    eliminate or to avoid. The game's characters are created in animé style,
    although they appear in full 3D. The backgrounds are pre-rendered, but very

    British sailors discovered a meteor buried deep in the Earth. Unwittingly, they

    that will eventually reunite the lost artifacts. Lara is in India searching for
    one of these precious items, unaware of its true history. She only knows that
    local beliefs state that the artifact was to contain great powers.\n
    It is up to you as Lara to use what little information you have at hand to begin
    your quest in finding the artifacts, and discovering their power.\n
    Tomb Raider III's graphics have been updated from the previous titles with a
    faster engine. Such improvements include more texture palettes for finer detail,
    improved water and reflection effects, smoother surfaces and real-time lighting
    effects.\n
    The story and gameplay are designed to unfold in a non-linear fashion, as in
    Lara's previous adventures, but even more so. This time gamers will be able to
    choose their own destiny by selecting the order in which they play each of the
    four main levels. The levels are also more open, with multiple routes to the
    same end. You may also choose to replay each level so you can avoid missing any
    part of the adventure.

  description:
    Shanghai: True Valor is a 3D puzzler based on the classic Oriental games Mah
    Jong and Shanghai. Each game starts off with a stack of tiles arranged in a
    pyramid shape. In order to win, the player is required to match up tiles by
    finding "free" tiles of the same type.
    .
    For instance, some tiles have numbers and some have pictures; the object is to
    find a tile not restricted, blocked, or under another tile. Once a player
    matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is
    reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up.
    Gameplay flows in this fashion until there are no more tiles or a stalemate.
    Stalemates are very common and occur when there are no possible matches or moves
    remaining.

    rolling logs and handy vines, which can be found smattered around the jungle.
    But there are new dangers as well, including the sinister flying darters, and
    new wonders to behold, such as gravity-defying lucense.\n
    Harry Jr. gets by much the same way his father did -- he can dodge out of the
    way, jump over obstacles, and take a swing at attackers with his trusty
    pick-axe. The object is to guide Harry Jr. through 11 levels, trying to discover
    what happened to the Moku civilization, and finally into a confrontation with
    the mighty Scourge, who's holding this alternate dimension hostage. Oh, and
    Harry might want to grab some treasure along the way too -- just like dear old
    Dad.\n

    The follow-up to 1996's Revelations Series: Persona, Persona 2 is a role-playing
    game pitting high-school teenagers against demons. While investigating the rumor
    of a curse at the Seven Sister's High School, magazine editor Mary Amano comes
    face-to-face with a murderer. A mysterious man by the name of Tatsuya Suou saves
    her, but from this moment on her life is irrevocably changed.\n
    As with many RPGs, players can gather a party of characters with distinct
    personalities and attacks. When a random battle begins, the player must first
    decide upon specific attacks and character turn-order before the fighting
    begins. Battles will continue until one side is eliminated, although there is
    also an option to partake in more traditional turn-based battles. Personas, the
    characters' powerful alter egos, can be used in battle to perform some of the
    more devastating attacks in the game. That said, not all encounters in the game
    need to be solved through fisticuffs.\n
    By using the game's Contact system, players can negotiate with demons and ask
    them questions. Each character in the party has a different way of negotiating
    and using the correct negotiator can mean the difference between a successful or
    failed negotiation. Success will sometimes result in the player receiving money,
    information, or Tarot Cards -- powerful items that can be used to summon new
    Personas.

    mode is for you. In this mode, players can take on specific types of challenges,
    ranging from Big Air to Slopestyle to Half-pipe, shredding through 12 courses to

    making them as tame or insane as you like.

    Utilizing a host of new gameplay elements, Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth expands
    upon the formula made popular by the cult classic Final Fantasy Tactics. The
    continent of Mardias serves as the game's primary world, and is divided into
    three kingdoms: Nightweld, the Valaimian Empire and Gerauld. The story begins as
    Valaimian troops advance into Nightweld, a peace-loving kingdom. Lacking the
    military might to repel the invaders from multiple fronts, Fazz - a mercenary
    and the game's protagonist - is hired to defend the Tower of Wind. Needless to
    say, this is just the beginning of a dire and perilous journey for the unwitting
    Fazz.\n
    As you and your party trek across the world map, you'll take part in various
    battles. Ready-for-Action Points (RAP) determine which, as well as the number of
    actions that can be performed by a particular character. The more actions
    performed (and thus, more RAPs expended) during a turn, the longer you'll have
    to wait for your next chance to act. When attacking, an interactive gauge
    appears that does damage based upon where the slider is stopped. Stopping it at
    the very end will result in greater damage dealt to the enemy. Wait too long
    however and the slider will return to the beginning.

  game: The Legend of Dragoon
  file: Legend of Dragoon, The (USA) (Disc 2).zip
  developer: Sony
  publisher: Sony
  description:
    Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers
    were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was
    the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies.
    Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent
    uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this,
    the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses,
    which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun
    as the past and future are about to collide...\n
    In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll
    travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well
    as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at
    once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference
    being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the
    souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and
    even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.\n
    Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a
    fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the
    party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known
    as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's
    ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an
    attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you
    press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center
    rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more
    hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.\n
    Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind,
    earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an
    enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another
    unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It
    allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button
    appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of
    the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small
    amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not
    properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a
    result.\n
    Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows,
    axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other
    items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to
    enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins
    with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in
    chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the
    in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors.
    There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle,
    found in chests, or purchased from merchants.\n
    Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to
    avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run
    into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you
    find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks
    of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and
    vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.

    The premise behind Koudelka takes place in Aberyswyth, Wales at a monastery
    known as Nementon Abbey. Found in a remote location, the abbey was built as a
    place of worship, learning and teaching; it was a place where scholars found
    peace.\n
    As time went by, Nementon Abbey was turned into a prison and it's inhabitants
    were confined to suffer and die. This practice continued for many years until
    the facility was purchased by Patrick Heyworth, a wealthy criminal who turned
    the once peaceful monastery into a refuge for vagrants and law-breakers. After
    Heyworth took control over the building, rumors of horror and great riches
    echoed throughout the world; the rumors lured many thieves, none of which
    returned to their homes.\n
    Forward to Halloween 1898 -- present day.

    A few days after the events described in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara
    Croft is presumed dead. Her close friends begin to recollect her previous
    adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include
    searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny
    from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the
    Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex
    in pursuit of the Iris artefact.

    Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with
    puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of
    the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on
    tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while
    crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also

    Gallop Racer is part horse racing simulation, part action/arcade racer.
    .
    When choosing horses for your stable, you have to take a lot of factors into
    account. For instance, is the horse a long or short distance runner? Does it do
    better on a dry track or a wet track? The factors appear to be endless at first.
    .
    After you have your horse, you then get to race it. Unlike several horse racing
    games from this time, you get to control the horse on the track instead of just
    watching. Actually, you really control the jockey. The controls basically boil
    down to hitting the face buttons when you need to get the horse moving; similar
    to riding the horse in The Ocarina of Time, only without the turning. However,
    you can't drive the horse on for the entire race, or else it'll tire and you'll
    be left in the dust.
    .
    Once the race is over, you get your cash. Each place earns you a specific
    amount, which you can then use to improve your ranks of race horses. If you'd
    rather not spend more money, you can also breed them, creating a "super racing
    horse" from two exceptional racers. The horse isn't really super, but it will
    almost certainly have a prolific career.

    The amazing adventurer Lara Croft returns once again with the third release in
    the Tomb Raider series for the PlayStation, Tomb Raider III: The Adventures of
    Lara Croft. This time she has some new moves such as crawl, monkey swing, and
    speed dash to help her through tough situations.\n
    The story unfolds with some background on the current situation. In years past,
    British sailors discovered a meteor buried deep in the Earth. Unwittingly, they
    looted four artifacts found with the meteor. One of these sailors kept a journal
    as they headed back to England -- he was the only one to make it home alive.\n
    With that in mind, the game begins with several key elements falling into place
    that will eventually reunite the lost artifacts. Lara is in India searching for
    one of these precious items, unaware of its true history. She only knows that
    local beliefs state that the artifact was to contain great powers.\n
    It is up to you as Lara to use what little information you have at hand to begin
    your quest in finding the artifacts, and discovering their power.\n
    Tomb Raider III's graphics have been updated from the previous titles with a
    faster engine. Such improvements include more texture palettes for finer detail,
    improved water and reflection effects, smoother surfaces and real-time lighting
    effects.\n
    The story and gameplay are designed to unfold in a non-linear fashion, as in
    Lara's previous adventures, but even more so. This time gamers will be able to
    choose their own destiny by selecting the order in which they play each of the
    four main levels. The levels are also more open, with multiple routes to the
    same end. You may also choose to replay each level so you can avoid missing any
    part of the adventure.

  description:
    The "2005" edition of the best-selling Madden NFL sports game series hits the
    field with another new season's worth of refinements and additions. Attention
    has been paid to the defensive game in this version, with enhancements intended
    to give gamers more options and more control when they're playing from the other
    side of the football. Many of this year's new features involve the NFL players
    themselves, however, calling upon gamers to maintain and develop their star
    athletes. Players are now rewarded for their good performances throughout the
    season, and individuals can be affected by the ebb and flow of morale.\n
    Madden 2005 offers "hit stick," control, which allows the right analog stick to
    be used to perform the kind of huge, momentum-shifting hits that fans will hear
    way up in the nosebleed section. Risks are involved, however, and players who
    miss tackles under the hit stick system's less rigid controls have only
    themselves to blame. Gamers can also involve themselves more deeply in defensive
    strategy than they could in earlier versions of Madden NFL. The new Defensive
    Playmaker Control system allows them to modify assignments for any player on the
    field, to set up blitzes, jams, and individual man-to-man coverage, right up
    until the moment the ball is snapped.

    Tetris Plus is a puzzle video game developed by Natsume and published by Jaleco
    for arcades exclusively in Japan in 1996, and was ported to the Game Boy, Sega
    Saturn, and PlayStation later that year. The game would be followed by a sequel,
    Tetris Plus 2, in 1997.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    The game consists of two main modes, Classic Mode and Puzzle Mode. Classic Mode
    functions like the original Tetris game for the Game Boy except with different
    music and visuals. However, because the cartridge has battery-powered SRAM, it
    also has the ability to remember your high-scores, unlike the original Game Boy
    game. Puzzle Mode is a twist on the classic gameplay that provides a new
    scenario. Also included is an editor for making Puzzle levels, and Link
    capability for going head-to-head with another player in either game mode. The
    Console Versions also have a two player Versus Mode which is essentially puzzle
    mode with two players racing for the finish line.\n
    PUZZLE MODE:\n
    The biggest addition to Tetris Plus is the Puzzle Mode. The player starts by
    choosing any of four world locations: Maya, Knossos, Egypt, or Angkor Wat. The
    final area, Atlantis, is unlocked by successfully completing the other four
    stages (in any order). Each of the four locations has a different level set.
    Once the game starts, the player is presented with a cluster of pre-placed
    bricks, and the professor enters the play-area through a disappearing gate. The
    objective is to get the professor to the bottom of the screen, by placing blocks
    and clearing lines, before the spiked ceiling at the top comes down and crushes
    him.\n
    The player's goal is to guide this archaeologist to the bottom as fast as
    possible. Two blocks wide and tall, he will aimlessly walk forward until he
    bumps into a block, after which he turns around and walks the other way. If he
    comes across a gap that is large enough for him to fit through, he will fall
    down onto the blocks below him. Conversely, if blocks are placed on top of him,
    he will climb up them until he reaches the top. As one could guess, if these
    blocks lead too closely to the spikes, the professor will die.\n
    Upon starting the level, the spiked ceiling will start at the top of the
    play-area. About once every eighteen seconds, it will move down one row, slowly
    taking away workable space. The player is able to make the ceiling go back up,
    however, if they can clear three or four rows at once. The ceiling will also
    destroy any placed blocks that are in its way. This can be used as a garbage
    disposal, by having it remove any unwanted pieces until the piece the player
    wants shows up.

    was included in Sony's Greatest Hits and Platinum Range of budget titles as a
    result of strong sales. A reinterpretation of the game was developed for the
    Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable.\n
    The plot focuses on Harry Mason as he searches for his daughter, Cheryl, who has
    disappeared following a car accident which left Harry unconscious. He finds
    Silent Hill to be largely abandoned, shrouded in a thick fog, snowing out of
    season, filled with monsters and being over taken by a hellish otherworld. As
    Harry scours the town, he begins learning about the history of Silent Hill and
    stumbles upon a cult ritual undertaken to bring a god to Earth.

    hatched sea-monkeys to the safety of the Venus Shell, but must do so without any
    direct control over them. Instead, players control Nautila, the sea-monkey's
    protector and guide, who is a 358-year old fish that uses her multi-purpose long
    nose for various actions.\n
    Predators, traps, plants, and objects stand in the way of getting her charges to
    safety, but Nautila can use some underwater creatures to help control the frisky
    sea-monkeys. Ollie the Octopus, goldfish, blowfish, jellyfish, lantern fish,
    dogfish, and more can all be harmful in some ways to the sea-monkeys, but their
    characteristics can also be harnessed by Nautila to good advantage. Other
    gameplay elements include using bubbles to either protect sea-monkeys or
    imprison their enemies, collecting a certain number of goldfish to clear levels,
    and the requirement to rescue a specific number of sea-monkeys within pre-set
    time limits per level.

    And then the Mist arrived.\n
    Filled with destructive means and hatred, the Mist covered the human's

    of loyally helping their masters, the mysterious stones turned against the
    humans; they became maniacal tools of evil, controlling minds and ruining
    innocent lives. The human existence was reduced tremendously with few survivors

    Muppet Monster Adventure is a action platform game, best compared with Spyro but
    with Muppet characters and a Halloween or ghost house setting.
    .
    The story starts with the Muppets attending the reading of Dr. Honeydew recently
    deceased uncle's will. Instead of going on a holiday to a tropical resort, Robin
    and the others find themselves at a rundown, creepy castle. Upon arriving
    Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy and others are captured and now it's up to young Robin
    (Kermit's nephew) to save the day.
    .
    The gameplay is best described as a collect-and-explore-em-up. You have to
    explore all the vast areas and collect gems and tokens. The HUD displays how
    much you have collected in a certain level. To get 100% you really have to find
    every corner and figure out how to get onto the hard to reach platforms.
    .
    In the first few levels, Robin gains four special powers by collecting special
    Muppet coins. When all coins of a group are collected, Robin can morph into
    different types of monsters at certain places. An icon will appear in the top
    right-hand corner, indicating that you can use this special ability. You can fly
    or float, climb certain walls, do a karate chop to break obstacles, or gain
    extra strength to push objects.
    .
    There are lots of large areas to explore. After every few levels the setting is
    changed. You go from the castle courtyards to large underwater sections, from
    Arabian nights setting to icy snow levels. During the game, Pepe the King Prawn
    appears in lots of places to give you gameplay advice. In each level, there also
    are a lot of mini games to be found, such as a race against an computer opponent
    to get to a certain location.

  game: Destruction Derby Raw
  file: Destruction Derby Raw (USA) (Demo).zip
  developer: Sony
  publisher: Sony
  description:
    Though not a product of Psygnosis, Destruction Derby Raw retains the same
    emphasis on wanton vehicular destruction as its forebears. "Wreckin' Racing,"
    "Battle," "Smash 4 $," are the three main modes of play, each offering
    additional sub-modes. Wreckin' Racing provides some sense of more traditional
    racing, in that the goal is to finish each track in one of the top three
    positions in order to advance through a championship circuit, unlocking courses
    (31 in all) all the while. Knocking the opposition around is not entirely
    discouraged either.\n
    Battle enables four players to compete in split-screen competition across
    varying "disciplines." The Assault sub-mode is simply a last-man-standing event
    in which competitors battle head-to-head. Here, options such as the track and
    lap count can be adjusted as desired. The Destruction Derby event, a series
    staple, now offers Classic and Arena variations. In Skyscraper, players aim to
    push one another off the roof of a tall building. Last of all is Pass Da Bomb,
    where the object is, of course, to not have possession of the bomb.\n
    Smash 4 $ mode is fairly self-explanatory. To earn money (functionally
    equivalent to points), players are expected to liberally dole out damage to any
    of the other racers. High-speed collisions satisfy the basic requirement for
    "stunts." By pulling off a Corkscrew, Teeth Puller, or Bone Cruncher, players
    earn these much-needed points, and also cause real-time damage to the unlucky
    recipient's car. Point totals and finishing place all count towards a final
    point tally, which is in turn measured against a predetermined value. Players
    must earn enough to continue on to the next event. Accumulated cash can then be
    spent to upgrade or repair your vehicle.

  developer: Take 2 Interactive

  description:
    Big Bass Fishing offers three gameplay modes, Arcade, Competition, and
    Challenge, as well as five specific events for anglers looking to wet their
    hooks while staying dry. Avoid bugs, insects, and bad weather as you try to
    outwit the big one in Free Fishing mode, Beat-the-Clock challenges, 2-Day
    Lunker, and 3-Day All Release contests, or the ultimate 3-Day Tournament. Unlock
    new locations via 15-minute timed events featuring goals such as catching two
    fish of any type, or reeling in two or three largemouth, smallmouth, or spotted
    bass of at least seven pounds in separate challenges.\n
    Arcade mode requires you to catch five fish in five minutes, with an additional
    90 seconds added for each one caught, and each time five fish are netted, you
    automatically move to a new location. Fourteen species of freshwater fish can be
    hooked, including multiple types of bass, bluegill, and more, in a dozen
    locations based in two lakes, a river, and a reservoir. The only fisherman in
    the game is a woman and you have no interactive control over boat movement.\n
    Gameplay consists of choosing the best of a wide selection of lures for each
    situation, casting, and reeling in the fish while using optional gauges that
    indicate line tension, fish interest, and the effectiveness of the lure. Two
    camera angles offer perspectives from behind the angler in the boat or
    underwater from a fish-eye view, and you can track the top catches of each type
    of fish in each event via the game's record section.

    place to keep darkness and chaos from falling on Pac-Land.\n
    Recently, someone has invaded the Enchanted Castle, kidnapping the princess and
    turning it into a haunted house. Professor Pac believes that whoever is
    responsible for that attack is planning to attack the rest of the four Wonders.

    In the near future, mankind's tinkering with the science of genetics and the
    developmental process of genome mapping has resulted in the accidental creation
    of a new disease known as EINDS. This disease, which attacks a cell's DNA and
    halts mitosis and meiosis (the processes that allow our cells to duplicate), has
    killed nearly a billion people and no hope of a cure has been discovered.\n
    With the disease spreading rapidly, it is feared that the manipulations of DNA
    will lead to mankind's complete undoing. It's up to three mercenaries and a
    mysterious woman with no past to combine their separate efforts into one
    adventure involving danger, intrigue, and supernatural involvement, with the
    prize perhaps being salvation for human kind.\n
    Fear Effect: Retro Helix is a cinematic adventure game for the PlayStation.
    Although it has been released after the original Fear Effect title, it is in
    actuality a prequel to the events in the first game, explaining how Hana
    Tsu-Vachel, Royce Glas, and Jacob Decourt wound up together. The game takes
    place over four levels, each of which has its own CD: futuristic, gritty Hong
    Kong, the Walled City of Xi'an, the Tomb of the First Emperor of China, and the

  publisher: Gremlin Interactive
  description:
    TNN Motorsports Hardcore 4X4 simulates the sport of big truck racing rather than
    going with an Arcade format (like Midway's Off Road Challenge). This will
    require players to be on the lookout hazards in the road, pay attention to
    vehicle physics, choose trucks wisely, and adjust to various terrain and weather
    conditions.\n
    There are six different terrain/track locations -- Dynamite Pass, a mountainous
    setting of various terrain; Ground Zero Gulch, bumpy canyon driving; Devil's
    Kitchen, located in the dusty desert; Mercurial Forest, paved mountain roadways;
    Hades Highway, a volcano; and Arctic Inferno, a slippery ice capade. Depending
    on which track you happen to be on, you'll need to pick a truck well suited for
    the race. It would be pointless to take a rig built for winter driving when
    you're in the middle of the desert.\n
    Fortunately, there is a truck for every type of terrain (seven in all, one of
    which is hidden). If you're heading into Arctic Inferno, you'd probably be wise
    in choosing the Snow Spider -- a rig built with icy traction in mind. The Fire
    Witch is perfect for racing on hardened lava and the Sand Blaster rolls through
    sandy deserts like a knife through hot butter.\n
    Choosing the right truck really comes into play in the Championship mode of
    Hardcore 4X4. This is the main gameplay option; players will be facing off
    against five other trucks across each of the six tracks. The idea is to come in
    first on every track -- if you do, you'll reign as the champion! For the big rig
    masters, try the Championship mode on the Extreme difficulty; finish it and
    you'll unlock a new truck.\n
    There are two other options as well -- the Single Race and Time Trial. The
    Single Race is simply a race against five computer-controlled opponents and the
    Time Trial is a fierce competition for the fastest lap and finishing time on the
    given track. In the latter option, 8 people can compete for the glory -- the
    best times are then saved on your Memory Card.\n
    In addition to all this, TNN Motorsports Hardcore 4X4 comes equipped with three
    different difficulty levels (novice, pro, and extreme) and various weather
    conditions. You have the option of setting the weather to Good (normal
    conditions), Overcast (foggy conditions), and Severe (rain, snow, sandstorms,
    and smoke). Each setting effect tracks differently and will in someway interfere
    with your quest for glory (fog will hamper your vision, snow makes for messy
    driving, etc). There is also a day or night setting.\n
    Features\n
    Dynamite Pass, Arctic Inferno, Devil's Kitchen -- six hardcore courses in all\n
    Independent four-wheel suspension for realistic in-the-mud action\n

  description:
    The Elimination event was the ultimate in televised arena combat. The
    participants were prisoners, of course, since no one sane enough would take up
    the gauntlet without some sort of incentive. Since those who survived the
    Elimination were granted reprieve and released back into society with both fame
    and wealth, the incentive was clear!\n
    All this came to an end during the Civil War. Instead of being televised, the
    Elimination served as a testing ground for weapons to be used in future battles.
    And the participants? They were prisoners of war, forced to compete solely for
    the amusement of the government. Now you happen to be next in line for the
    Elimination, and you're going to have to use all of your survival instincts to
    make it through alive.\n
    Eliminator lets you select one of four different crafts, each rated in shield
    power, weapons and top speed: the Redeemer, Freedom, Liberty and Survivor. The
    Elimination event is comprised of eight arenas filled with robotic creatures and
    futuristic defenses. You'll begin play in the Penitentiary, and then navigate
    through the Maze, Asylum, Cage, Chasm, Monastary, Tomb and Fortress.\n
    While the goal of surviving each arena may sound straightforward enough, there
    are a few things any budding pilot should be aware of before strapping in.
    First, your ship has a bomb attached to it! If you don't complete the arena
    within the time limit, the bomb will detonate. Another thing to worry about is
    the boss character after each level, so make sure you collect as many of the
    twelve assorted weapons as you can within the arenas.\n
    Progress will be saved after each level for those with a memory card, and two
    players can duke it out in three special duel zones: the Pit, the Dome and the
    Labyrinth. The object in the multi-player game is to simply destroy your
    opponent's base while protecting your own. Yet in order to destroy a base, you
    must first find the three Warp Bombs hidden somewhere within the arena!

    Taking place only ten days after the events in the original G-Police, the sequel
    G-Police: Weapons of Justice centers around a group of small gangs in Callisto.
    The various gangs are taking advantage of the G-Police by exploiting their
    weakened and exhausted task force. With crime back on the rise, the city will
    have to pull through and pray for a miracle --- fortunately, they're prayers
    have been answered.
    .
    After an attempt to silence the terrorist organizations, your squad receives
    word of Marines being sent in to help with the current situation. Unfortunately,
    they're a few days away from the city and the G-Police can't keep things under
    control; the rivalry between good and evil heats up before their arrival.
    .
    When the Marines and their heavy firepower enter the city -- things are already
    too late. Those small gangs have turned into full-blown crime syndicates making
    the force of good's job much harder. Fortunately, your squad of officers has the
    upper hand -- the G-Police uses a variety of five attack choppers including the
    Venom and Havoc. Additionally, the Marines have supplied their Corsair cruise
    ship, Raptor, and Rhino --- a giant mechanized robot used for mass destruction
    and a heavily armed patrol vehicle, respectively.

  description:
    Resident Evil Survivor is a spin-off of Capcom's survival horror series. Instead
    of giving players control of characters from a third-person perspective as in
    previous games, Resident Evil Survivor takes place from a first-person
    viewpoint. Originally conceived as a light-gun game (Capcom opted to take this
    feature out of the U.S. release, citing heightened tension over gun violence),
    it essentially plays like one. Players may rotate their view and move up and
    down hallways, but when the zombies come slouching, it will be time to let loose
    a hail of bullets to bring them down.\n
    Although the plot of Resident Evil Survivor is a side-story, it still refers to
    the events of other Resident Evil games. Raccoon City, the now-famous American
    suburb gripped by an industrial plague that turned its citizens into zombies, is
    gone, blown completely off of the map in order to keep the dreaded virus from
    spreading. Unfortunately, Umbrella, the wicked corporation that created the
    deadly outbreak, hasn't stopped spreading its own dark research. The company has
    victimized another small town, and apparently in a desperate attempt to flee the
    carnage, a helicopter has crashed. In this chopper is a man who cannot remember
    who he is or what he was doing prior to the crash. He is armed with only a
    handgun, and ahead of him he has a task that none would envy -- to escape this
    nightmare town crawling with zombies and other foul creatures, and discover who
    he is.\n
    Items, weapons, and enemies have all been borrowed from the main series, as has
    the jumpy, tense atmosphere, the strange dialogue, and the series' trademark
    eerie music. The only noticeable thing missing from Survivor are the puzzles
    found in the other Resident Evil titles. This game is about action, through and
    through.

    Psychic Detective is an innovative slant on the interactive movie. You're Eric
    Fox, a psychic detective who can transmit his psychic self to others, to see
    through their eyes and hear through their ears. That way you can find out things
    about the case you couldn't otherwise. He has been employed by a strange woman
    to discover the mystery behind the death of her father.\n
    The huge mystery starts with Eric meeting the beautiful young woman named Laina.
    She introduces you to the other members of her family. Once another character
    appears on screen, an icon with their face on appears on the border. Click on
    this icon, and Eric will be able to delve into that person?s mind. This comes in
    handy for getting to know who is suspicious and who is innocent. As you can
    guess, the game is packed full of characters, so the mystery will take a heck of
    a long time to finish.\n
    Eric is able to receive weird psychic flashbacks, which usually feature either
    scenes of murder, sex or just suspicious goings on. He can influence the
    behaviour of other characters (annoy them, seduce them, etc.). As well as
    people, the smallest of items can give vital clues, even a stubbed out
    cigarette. It all depends on how carefully you watch the screen border. Special
    ?Psychic Collectors? must be picked up ? these can magnify Eric?s psychic
    powers. When one is activated, the screen goes into a swirl of colours, and
    presents the player with a variety of choice s. As the game progresses, Eric
    gets to play the Black Diamond game. This is a psychic battle which takes place
    on a board, but it?s a bit strange.\n
    The game has many different conclusions. It's a dark story though, and most
    people might not want to play through again.\n
    It?s gonna be a big mystery to solve. Heck, there are three CDs for this thing!
    Clues to the mystery are everywhere, and by touching certain objects Eric can
    reveal their history. All this is viewed from a first person perspective as Eric
    chats to all the other characters\n
    In the PSX version of the game you can save the game anywhere and at anytime
    except during the Black Diamond games. There are some scenes that are removed
    comparing to the Pc and 3do versions of the game.

    Loosely based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "Water Margins"
    (Shuihuzhuan) by Shi Nai'an. The game is a fantasy RPG set in an imaginary
    universe, its main theme being political struggle. The hero of the game is the
    young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire,
    presently controlling the land of Toran. Through a series of events the hero
    becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization known
    as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to
    tear himself away from everything that has been sacred to him, including his own
    father?
    .
    Suikoden is a console-style RPG with several unusual additions. There are three
    kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional
    turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active
    party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow
    limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also army battles,
    where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc.,
    and one-on-one fights.
    .
    The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as
    their home base and fortress.108 characters can be recruited in the game, a
    tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those characters
    will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while
    others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various
    ways.

  game: Theme Park

  developer: Electronic Arts
  publisher: Electronic Arts
  description:
    Theme Park is a construction and management simulation game designed by Bullfrog
    Productions and originally released in 1994, in which the player designs and
    operates an amusement park.\n
    Like most of Bullfrog's games, Theme Park is permeated by an eccentric sense of
    humor. Theme Hospital is Bullfrog's thematic successor to the game, while Chris
    Sawyer's Roller Coaster Tycoon series has evolved the concept to offer a far
    more realistic selection of rides.\n
    Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this
    strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the
    available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some
    space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and
    trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses
    to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides
    that loop around other rides.\n
    Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and
    souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to
    maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running
    smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.\n
    You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage
    over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability
    closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that
    research is adequately funded to produce new rides.\n
    It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park
    design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    Starting with a free plot of land in the United Kingdom and few hundred thousand
    dollars, the player must build a profitable amusement park, making money by
    opening rides and selling merchandise and refreshments. The goal is to increase
    the park's value and available cash so that the park can be sold and a new lot
    can be bought from another part of the world and start building a new theme
    park.[3] Newer products can be bought after researching them. Once enough money
    has been made the player can move on to newer plots. Plots are located all over
    the world and have many different factors that affect gameplay, including the
    economy, weather, terrain and land value.\n
    There are over thirty attractions available in the game. Depending on the
    platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides. There are simple rides
    like the bouncy castle and tree house, and more complicated and expensive rides
    like the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel.\n
    There is a focus in the staff side of the park as well. People employed in the
    park include entertainers, security guards, mechanics, and handymen. Lack of
    staff can cause problems, including messy footpaths, rides breaking down (and
    with sufficient neglect, exploding), crime, and unhappy visitors. Occasionally,
    wages and the price of goods must be negotiated; failure to negotiate results in
    staff strikes and loss of shipment. Theme Park offers three levels of
    simulation, with the higher difficulties requiring more management of aspects
    such as logistics.

    mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use.
    Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.
    .
    However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of
    driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits(money),
    trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular
    championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks.
    Money earned by winning championships can be used to purchase additional
    vehicles, and for parts and tuning of all vehicles.
    .
    Gran Turismo features 180 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as reversed
    versions). Two Honda del Sol cars from 1995 were included in the Japanese
    version, but were removed from the North American and European versions. They

    after winnin' another race, but some new folks have come into town; folks that
    aren't interested in the scenic back roads that Hazzard has to offer. No,
    they're more interested in pinnin' a dirty crime on Hazzard's own Daisy Duke,
    the sweetest flower in the south. It'll be up to Luke, Bo, and Daisy to avoid
    Enos, Rosco, and that troublemakin' Boss Hog while solving this crime and put
    those no good crooks behind bars. Thankfully, they have all the tools they'll
    need: Daisy's trusty jeep and, of course, the famous General Lee.\n
    In Dukes of Hazzard II: Daisy Dukes it Out, it will take a player's racing
    prowess and lead foot to make it through the pitfalls and troubles of this dusty
    country county. Players will control either the Duke boys in their high-powered
    General Lee or Daisy in her jeep as they sweep through the dirt roads and
    downtown of Hazzard. Levels alternate between the two vehicles, and the
    objectives you must complete are varied as well. You might find yourself
    outrunning the law or perhaps showing someone the sights in Hazzard. You might
    even deliver some mail, but eventually you'll get down to some good,
    old-fashioned crime fighting.\n
    The physics of the game are decidedly arcade in their handling, focusing more on
    speed and hi-jinks rather than precision. The levels that you drive through
    offer ramps and a variety of short cuts through corn-fields and back roads.
    Players can also pick up several different items, like wrenches to fix their
    damaged vehicles or nitro gas to give them a short boost of speed. If the
    single-player missions become a drag, then there's a two-player mode that allows

    Meanwhile, Croc's life changed one day after discovering a bottled up message
    lying on the beach. The writers of the letter stated they were searching for
    their long-lost crocodile son. Thinking they could be his parents, Croc took the
    letter to King Rufus who suggested he journey to a faraway land, seek out the
    help of other Gobbos, and find his folks. The Gobbos then built a seesaw
    catapult to launch Croc to the foreign land, kick-starting his latest adventure.

    Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented
    as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show
    appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive
    deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade
    troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.\n
    As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped
    Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired
    cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist
    organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives
    intact.\n
    Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother
    and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large
    metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time.
    An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert
    Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of
    the crusade.\n
    Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to
    overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas
    of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to
    create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages,
    the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she
    would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.\n

    Inuyasha: A Feudal Fairy Tale is a 2D fighting game starring characters from

    15-year old high school student Kagome Higure, who inadvertently slips back in

    the Sacred Jewel of the Four Souls. "Feudal Fairy Tale," the game's main mode of

    journey through the game, acquiring shards, more characters become available.\n
    Each character is able to perform both strong and weak attacks, as well as
    throws and counter attacks. Players can also execute more powerful combination
    maneuvers, including special and super attacks, which can only be initiated when
    the Spiritual meter is filled. Additionally, specific attacks can cause
    opponents to drop shards that, once claimed, will fill the Spiritual meter more

    In Grand Theft Auto, you assume the role of a street thug working for an
    organized syndicate of criminals that specializes in stealing cars. Every time
    your pager beeps, the boss needs you to steal something for him -- if you don't
    get to a payphone and answer the message, you'll be in hot water (or is that
    cold water at the bottom of the East River).\n
    After receiving your mission, you'll have to navigate city streets that are
    bustling with pedestrians, cops (your worst enemies), and traffic jams. Because
    you're pressed for time, you can't just walk to your destination on foot -- that
    would take too long. Instead, you'll have to go car jacking, the art of
    physically removing people out of their vehicles and stealing it.
    .
    .

    This is the premise behind Grand Theft Auto, an overhead action game of
    thievery. There are four large cities in which you'll have to steal cars, shoot
    rival gang members, and complete missions for the boss. Each mission requires
    you to get something from point "A" to point "B". For example, the head honcho
    wants to pull off a bank heist -- instead of using regular cars, they want you
    to steal a couple taxicabs for them. This way, the cops won't be able to find
    them as easily in traffic.

    Buttercup, three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers, as well as their
    "father", the brainy scientist Professor Utonium, who all live in the fictional
    city of Townsville, USA. The girls are frequently called upon by the town's
    childlike mayor to help fight nearby criminals using their powers.\n
    The Powerpuff Girls revolves around the adventures of Blossom,bubbles, and
    buttercup . Each of the girls has a color; Bubbles is blue, Buttercup is green
    and Blossom is pink. The plot of a typical episode is some humorous variation of
    standard superhero and tokusatsu fare, with the girls using their powers to
    defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls also
    have to deal with normal issues young children face, such as sibling rivalries,
    loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a
    security blanket. Episodes often contain more or less hidden references to older
    pop culture.\n
    Powerpuff Girls: Chemical X-traction is a 3D fighting adventure featuring
    characters from Craig McCracken's hugely successful Cartoon Network series.\n
    Help Bubbles dispense a little justice on the wily Mojo Jojo or guide Buttercup
    to deliver a nice knuckle sandwich to deserving Gangreen Gang members.\n
    In the story mode, players can pick up objects and throw them at an enemy to
    decrease their opponents health meter. They can use superpowered attacks by
    collecting vials of Chemical X. If the player successfully defeats the enemy in
    two out of three rounds, they move to the next enemy location.\n

    powerful creatures during battle.\n
    As your Digimon take damage, a blast meter gradually fills. When full, it allows
    the creature to Blast Digivolve, imbuing it with an increase in attack level.
    Tamers also have the ability to merge two creatures using the DNA Digivolve
    ability, which will yield an all-new Digimon who performs a random attack before

    join an underground organization dedicated to annihilating this cult, and are
    outfitted with an armed car (customizable to an extent).  The 25 missions vary,

    Ultimate Fighting Championship is based on the no-holds-barred martial art
    tournament of the same name. What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart)

    styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a
    kickboxer.

    The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos,
    holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves,
    featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or
    force him to tap out early.
    .
    There are multiple game modes included. Among them are a survival mode, that has
    you face a string of enemies with minimal recovery, and career mode, which
    allows you to customize and improve your fighting style as you win fights.

    this is where you come in. You play the role of Millennia, a young woman who was
    brainwashed at an early age to do the Timenoids' bidding. She now believes that
    the humans must be exterminated from the world, which is rather ironic, since
    she is human herself. Yet if she succeeds, the Timenoids have promised her
    immortality and the power to become one of their own...\n
    In this sequel to Tecmo's Deception, you are once again placed inside a castle
    to lure invaders into various traps. The game differs from the original in
    several ways, however. The view is no longer first-person, so you can see your
    character at all times. Multiple traps can also be triggered at once (up to
    three), forming even deadlier combinations than the original. In addition, the
    vibration mode is supported on the Dual Shock Analog Controller to provide
    feedback on each gruesome death. Prepare for a non-linear journey as the
    decisions you make during the game affect the type of ending you'll receive.

    (Shuihuzhuan) by Shi Nai'an. The game is a fantasy RPG set in an imaginary
    universe, its main theme being political struggle. The hero of the game is the
    young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire,
    presently controlling the land of Toran. Through a series of events the hero
    becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization known
    as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to
    tear himself away from everything that has been sacred to him, including his own
    father?
    .
    Suikoden is a console-style RPG with several unusual additions. There are three
    kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional
    turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active
    party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow
    limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also army battles,
    where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc.,
    and one-on-one fights.
    .
    The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as
    their home base and fortress.108 characters can be recruited in the game, a
    tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those characters
    will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while
    others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various
    ways.

  description:
    Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters,
    that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story
    of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the
    'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty
    eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant
    towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional
    military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world.
    Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.
    .
    The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D
    backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact
    with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself
    occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character
    takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even
    delay or cancel an enemy's turn.
    .
    The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience
    points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon
    (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use,
    powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are
    a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.

    an ordinary sword, but the legendary talking sword Dymlos, who has been sleeping
    for many years and who can be awakened only if the world is in grave danger. But
    what exactly is the danger that awakened Dymlos now? With the help of a few
    friends, Stahn decides to explore the world and to find out what is wrong.\n
    "Tales of Destiny" is a follower of the SNES RPG Tales of Phantasia. The combat

    him perform various attacks. Other party members are controlled by the game's
    AI, but you can pause the battle at any time and assign new combat style to any
    one of them.\n
    PLOT:\n
    In the past, a comet crashed into the world, throwing dust clouds into the sky
    and shrouding the world in cold and darkness. At about the same time, the
    inhabitants, the Aethers, discovered a new form of energy from the meteorite's
    core, which they named Lens. Combining this with further research, the people
    were able to create cities in the sky and live in them. Unfortunately, only a
    select few were chosen, leaving the rest of the people to remain on the bleak
    surface of the planet. These people became known as the Erthers.\n
    Over time, the sky's inhabitants became known as the Aetherians and their
    Aeropolis cities. They created a horrific weapon called the Belcrant that shot
    down any who dared oppose them. This caused full scale war to erupt between the
    two civilizations, now known as the Aeth'er Wars. However, regardless of their
    will and persistence, the Aetherians continued to have the power to dominate
    every engagement through the use of their superweapon.\n
    In their disgust of their civilization's elitist behavior, a group of Aetherian
    scientists went to the surface. There, with aid from the people, they were able
    to create special swords, called Swordians, that were sentient. Unlike other
    weapons, these swords chose their masters and were able to call upon the
    elements of nature to do their will. Using these weapons, the people of the
    surface finally had an edge against the Aetherians.\n
    Thanks in part to the Swordians and their masters, scores of Aeropolis were sunk
    to the depths of the ocean. In the end, the Erthers claimed victory over the
    Aetherians. Thousands of years later, this story has been mostly forgotten. In
    the meantime, the purposeless Swordians fell into a deep stasis sleep, only to
    awaken when grave threats rose once again.\n
    The story of the game begins when country-boy-turned-adventurer Stahn Aileron,
    who seeks fame and adventure, sneaks aboard the flying ship Draconis as a
    stowaway. He is found out by the crew and forced to work as a deckhand, but when
    a large hostile force attacks the ship, the crew is overwhelmed and Stahn breaks
    free during the ensuing chaos. Looking for a usable weapon to fend off the
    attackers, he gains access to a storeroom and discovers a "junk" sword. However,
    the sword starts talking to him, calling itself Dymlos and claiming to be a
    sentient Swordian from the Aeth'er Wars. Armed with Dymlos, Stahn fights his way
    to an escape pod, which he uses to escape the rapidly descending ship before it
    crashes into the ground.\n
    Dymlos becomes the key to the fame, fortune, and adventure Stahn seeks as the
    young man meets other Swordians, quickly becoming embroiled in a battle for a
    relic of the Aeth'er Wars: a huge, extremely powerful Lens called the Eye of
    Atamoni.\n
    GAMEPLAY:\n
    Tales of Destiny continues the trademark Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS) of
    the Tales series, with the E-LMBS (Enhanced Linear Motion Battle System), there
    are some graphical enhancements to the system as it was first implemented in
    Tales of Phantasia. Nevertheless, the combat is still very similar to the first
    game in the series, taking place on a 2-D plane where characters and enemies act
    in real time. Typical RPG conventions of HP, TP, experience, and leveling apply.
    Melee and ranged attacks are executed in real time, with spell casting requiring
    a chanting time that increases directly with the complexity of the spell being
    cast. When the chanting of a spell is complete, game-time temporarily stops as
    the spell animation is carried out and damage is assigned, so spells essentially
    act as interrupts. Special melee and ranged attacks do more damage or have more
    hits than normal attacks, but require technical points, or TP, to be consumed
    for use. Also, the battle system rewards the player with extra experience for
    stringing together multi-hit combos. The end result of this break from
    traditional turn-based RPG battle systems is a more fast-paced and reaction
    oriented system that behaves more like a fighting game and less like a typical
    Final Fantasy-esque title.

    items you've found in your storage shed.\n
    Find arrows, clubs, swords, shields, staves, safes, scrolls, pots, herbs, bread
    and rings so that Torneko can heal and defend himself, and make sure to keep
    Torneko well fed with bread or he'll lose strength. Torneko: The Last Hope also
    features claymation full motion video sequences, turn-based combat, and over 100
    items to find.\n

    wide variety of settings, ranging from the South American jungle to the ruins of
    the Moku civilization that lie behind a dimensional rift.
    .
    Some old obstacles and enemies appear, such as tar pits that can open up beneath
    Harry and swallow him whole, ever-present scorpions, and old favorites like
    rolling logs and handy vines, which can be found smattered around the jungle.
    But there are new dangers as well, including the sinister flying darters, and
    new wonders to behold, such as gravity-defying lucense.\n
    Harry Jr. gets by much the same way his father did -- he can dodge out of the
    way, jump over obstacles, and take a swing at attackers with his trusty
    pick-axe. The object is to guide Harry Jr. through 11 levels, trying to discover
    what happened to the Moku civilization, and finally into a confrontation with
    the mighty Scourge, who's holding this alternate dimension hostage. Oh, and
    Harry might want to grab some treasure along the way too -- just like dear old
    Dad.\n

    lair\n
    * Swing, jump, and hurdle to avoid enemies and obstacles in each environment\n

    Dr. Edward Kirk is supposed to be dead. Three years ago while working to

    went awry and terminated the brilliant scientist's life -- or so it was thought.
    It was recently learned, however, that Dr. Kirk is very much alive and
    continuing his work at a Borginia Republic research facility on Ibis Island.\n
    In order to investigate the situation, an elite special forces team including

    shotguns, dart guns, and other weapons throughout the island. To gain access to

  description:
    Earth's defense satellites accidentally launch nuclear warheads due to computer
    malfunction.  Our planet is destroyed, except for a few factions that rebuild
    their strength and attempt to dominate the brave new world.  As you make your
    way across the wasteland, hunting down artifacts and destroying hostile forces,
    you find out that the satellite's unexpected nuclear launch may not have been
    entirely accidental after all...
    .
    You are in charge of searching the land for technological artifacts held by the
    other fellows.  These artifacts are then researched to create new weapons,
    chasses, and propulsion types, all of which are interchangable, meaning there
    are over 2000 units for you to blow stuff up with.  You can build tanks,
    hovercraft, Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) vehicles, as well as cyborg units.
    There are machine guns, missile launchers, flame throwers, mortars, etc.  Since
    all your technology comes from artifacts you swipe from your enemies, you are
    almost always fighting with weapons a step below what the other guy has, meaning
    you have to rely on your strategic prowess instead of sheer military
    superiority.  The battlefield is fully 3D, the camera is rotatable and zoomable,
    and all units are 3D as well, except for humans, which are sprites, but they
    aren't too plentiful, so it's a minor point.

  game: Destruction Derby Raw
  file: Destruction Derby Raw (USA).zip
  developer: Sony
  publisher: Sony
  description:
    Though not a product of Psygnosis, Destruction Derby Raw retains the same
    emphasis on wanton vehicular destruction as its forebears. "Wreckin' Racing,"
    "Battle," "Smash 4 $," are the three main modes of play, each offering
    additional sub-modes. Wreckin' Racing provides some sense of more traditional
    racing, in that the goal is to finish each track in one of the top three
    positions in order to advance through a championship circuit, unlocking courses
    (31 in all) all the while. Knocking the opposition around is not entirely
    discouraged either.\n
    Battle enables four players to compete in split-screen competition across
    varying "disciplines." The Assault sub-mode is simply a last-man-standing event
    in which competitors battle head-to-head. Here, options such as the track and
    lap count can be adjusted as desired. The Destruction Derby event, a series
    staple, now offers Classic and Arena variations. In Skyscraper, players aim to
    push one another off the roof of a tall building. Last of all is Pass Da Bomb,
    where the object is, of course, to not have possession of the bomb.\n
    Smash 4 $ mode is fairly self-explanatory. To earn money (functionally
    equivalent to points), players are expected to liberally dole out damage to any
    of the other racers. High-speed collisions satisfy the basic requirement for
    "stunts." By pulling off a Corkscrew, Teeth Puller, or Bone Cruncher, players
    earn these much-needed points, and also cause real-time damage to the unlucky
    recipient's car. Point totals and finishing place all count towards a final
    point tally, which is in turn measured against a predetermined value. Players
    must earn enough to continue on to the next event. Accumulated cash can then be
    spent to upgrade or repair your vehicle.

    After firing your grappling hook to the rooftop of a small house, you pull
    yourself up and notice a guard pacing back and forth on the ground. He doesn't
    see you as you begin to crawl and sneak around on the roof. If he detects your
    presence, you will be in a world of hurt; you will blow your mission and risk
    death. Patiently, you wait for the right time to jump down -- and end his life
    while his back is turned.\n
    Set in 16th century Japan, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins is a simulation of the ways
    of the stealthy ninja. You'll chose between two characters, Rikimaru and Ayame,
    with a main objective of remaining unseen throughout ten non-linear missions.
    You will move through the shadows, make your way across rooftops, dash through
    trees -- anything to cloak yourself from enemy sight. While completing the
    missions, you are judged on three levels that measure your success in the fields
    of elusiveness and effectiveness.\n
    Each mission is different in its design and goal. Your mentor will have you run
    secret errands to informants, kill evil merchants and thieves, and rescue
    captive ninjas. Along the way, the enemy resistance has set up traps and
    assigned guards to keep a watchful eye for any interference (that would be you).
    Because Tenchu is a simulation of sorts, running up and engaging an enemy combat
    is not advised -- that's not the way of the ninja.\n
    A ninja is cunning and in order to uphold his duty, he must remain unseen. If
    you brazenly walk up to a group of enemies and try to kill them all, you may get
    through a couple, but you will ultimately fail and dishonor your people. As far
    as weaponry goes, make use of throwing stars and actual ninja assassin swords.
    For the truly cunning players, poisoned rice and smoke bombs are included as
    special items. If a guard will not go away, try putting some rice down for him
    to eat - he'll get sick and collapse.

    has several different kinds of attacks at his disposal. He has traditional melee

    and eradicate pesky monsters that block his path.\n

    obstacle in this journey, as he'll also have to deal with deceptive and shady

  description:
    Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of
    Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a
    basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.
    .
    The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to
    fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the
    help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours,
    two-on-two and three-on-three.
    .
    Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on
    the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is
    a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about
    five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.
    .
    The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player
    versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode.
    In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps,
    you can actually have a three-on-three game.
    .
    The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola
    Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig,
    Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang,
    Blanko and Nawt.
    .
    There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds.
    These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's
    similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired
    and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.
    .
    The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic
    Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five
    matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of
    the team is substituted in and out.
    .
    There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory
    cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.

    released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the
    long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim's bodies into
    grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous
    brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either
    his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his
    daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam
    the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it
    all, Adam Crowley.
    .
    Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and
    Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving,
    an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill
    monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just

    Fox Kids show to the PlayStation. Players will take on the role of one of five
    Power Rangers -- red, green, blue, yellow and pink -- and battle evil throughout
    the universe and throughout time. Each Ranger has his or her own different
    attribute levels in categories like power, speed and martial arts skill.\n
    Each of the game's eight levels takes place in a different time period. Players
    will have to tame the Wild West, take down evil cavemen in the Stone Age, and go
    toe to toe with pirates on the high seas. Most levels require players to find
    objects scattered about the level before they can go on to fight the boss. And
    once they beat a boss the first time, it will mutate into a giant sized version,
    as on the show. It is then necessary to dispatch the villain by taking control
    of the Power Rangers' famous Blue Zord.\n
    Once a character has entered a level, they have a certain amount of time to
    complete the stage. If the timer runs out, the level doesn't end but players
    won't receive a power-bar bonus. To best the clock in any given level, players
    will come upon small and large hourglass icons. These icons slow down the clock
    or add a large chunk of time. Players will also find health power-ups and
    charger stations where they can regain the power to perform special maneuvers
    they will learn throughout the game. And if you run out of time in a level, you
    always have the opportunity to give it a try again.

    contain a certain amount of mana, and when destroyed, it's released. You
    complete a world (there's about 75 of them!) when a certain amount of mana has

    A really interesting aspect of mana is that you can access more spells the more

  description:
    The game takes place upon the Shee Ark, where the player must save the Norns by
    opening up the doors to the different Terrariums (the same that are in Creatures
    3). Around the world are small, blue stars that must be placed in a machine by
    the Norns in order to generate a key. However, the stars have a limited
    lifespan, with stars that rotate faster nearing the end of their lifespan. When
    exactly 25 Stars are placed in the machine, it will generate a key. In order to
    be able to carry stars, Norns must be trained from an early age.\n
    Unlike previous Creatures games, each Norn must collect ten hearts in order to
    become fertile. These hearts are found throughout the shee ark, and can be
    collected by both Scrubby and the Norns. Ettins and Grendels are always
    infertile.\n
    Around the world are a variety of medicinal plants, that closely, if not
    exactly, resemble Herbs from Creatures. These herbs have special effects on
    Norns, such as promoting sleep, getting rid of illness and decreasing Tiredness.
    Too many of these herbs can cause addiction. There are also several varieties of
    weeds found in the Jungle Terrarium that can be detrimental to a Norn's
    health.\n
    Like the original Creatures Game, Norns in Creatures: Raised in Space are
    programmed to die from Illness at a Certain Age. The average lifespan of a Norn
    in this game is around four hours.

    slower but packs a wallop in shields and firepower. Firepower comes in the form
    of mini-guns and rockets while pickups include weapon ammunition, boosts, and

    .
    Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for
    such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat
    skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in
    power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" -
    special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in
    battle.
    .
    The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy
    games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo
    attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple
    Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using
    their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the
    enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them
    entirely.
    .
    The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time,
    which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option,
    which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds
    even more endings to the already existing ones.

  developer: Taito
  publisher: Taito
  description:
    QIX Neo is a remake of Volfied, Taito's arcade game from 1989. The graphics and
    sounds were upgraded, but the basic gameplay remains the same, with the player
    controlling a tiny ship moving over a green contour line. The thin line is drawn
    over the edges of the screen, framing the game field. The ship acts as a cursor
    and has to be used to draw a square or rectangular extension into the field,
    thus removing it and slowly decreasing the size of the available space. Enemies
    roam each level, moving in random patterns around the screen but always
    following the movements of the cursor. The ship has a force-field shield around
    it, and only becomes vulnerable when drawing new lines.
    .
    The player has to quickly close the sections, timing it correctly to avoid
    collision with any of the foes or their projectiles. The enemies can be
    eliminated by connecting a section where they are standing, or by using one of
    the power-ups. The power-ups are stored inside boxes, that in some levels keep
    appearing and disappearing, and can be collected by removing a section with one
    of them inside. Most of the powers are temporary, giving lasers to destroy the
    smaller aliens, freezing the enemies for a few seconds, increasing the speed of
    the ship and helping in other ways. Each level is finished after removing at
    least 70% of the field, or if the large boss monster that shoots at random
    intervals is killed in some way. A port of the original game is also included,
    using the old assets but with a horizontal orientation.

    In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of
    the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly
    encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans
    prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich,
    nicknamed "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into
    violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.
    .
    The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional
    battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be
    found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that
    often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel
    Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field
    generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.
    .
    The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns,
    unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies
    reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge
    shields or rearm weapons.
    .
    After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful
    weapons and replace the mech's armor.

    with other force beams branching off it. Each of the eight ships is connected to
    the track by a force beam, and each ship draws energy directly from the force
    beams. Energy to your ship can be drained by taking corners too fast, firing
    your weapons, getting hit by enemy fire, colliding with other ships, and by
    simply driving the ship. You can increase your energy by picking up power-ups
    that you'll find along the tracks. Each ship comes with a few extra engine power
    cells which can be used to break the sound barrier.\n
    Cyberspeed is broken up into three different kinds of races: Tournament Race,
    Free Race, and Time Trial. The tournament consists of ten different basic races
    against seven opponents, with additional bonus races that pit you against Super
    Ships. The Free Race is a single race against seven opponents, and you can only
    race on the first two tracks or on ones that you have already completed. The
    Time Trial is similar to the Free Race, but with only two pilots competing. In
    each of the three kinds of races, you can choose between eight different ships.
    Each ship is ranked according to thrust, mass, speed, and shield strength, and
    each ship is equipped with the same kinds of weapons: plasma bolts, missiles,

    blue-skinned Timenoids are determined to wipe out the inferior human race, and
    this is where you come in. You play the role of Millennia, a young woman who was
    brainwashed at an early age to do the Timenoids' bidding. She now believes that
    the humans must be exterminated from the world, which is rather ironic, since
    she is human herself. Yet if she succeeds, the Timenoids have promised her
    immortality and the power to become one of their own...\n
    In this sequel to Tecmo's Deception, you are once again placed inside a castle
    to lure invaders into various traps. The game differs from the original in
    several ways, however. The view is no longer first-person, so you can see your
    character at all times. Multiple traps can also be triggered at once (up to
    three), forming even deadlier combinations than the original. In addition, the
    vibration mode is supported on the Dual Shock Analog Controller to provide
    feedback on each gruesome death. Prepare for a non-linear journey as the
    decisions you make during the game affect the type of ending you'll receive.
    Maybe, just maybe, you'll remember your past...

    another devious plan. Hefty is just one Smurf and needs you to help him return

    PGA Tour 96 for the Sony PlayStation will transport you into 3D rendered
    professional golf courses, providing excellent rounds of golf at a fraction of
    the cost in actual life. You'll get to play against professionals and compete
    for thousands of dollars all with just a few button pushes!\n
    Whether you know how to play golf or not, PGA Tour 96 will produce a feeling for
    the actual game play. For golfers, I suspect the game will create a desire to go
    out and play the real thing, and for others to give the game a try.\n
    There are five different modes in the game. Stroke play is a regular game of
    golf consisting of either the front 9, back 9, or all 18 holes of a particular
    course. Practice play allows you to play any hole on a golf course to improve
    yourself. In Tournament you'll play against fifty-six other PGA Tour
    professionals plus the one to four players in your party and compete for cash by
    playing either 18, 36 or 72 holes. If you're playing 72 holes, you'll have to
    make the cut by being one of the top 40 players after the first round. The Skins
    Game assigns a monetary value to each hole and you'll want to win as many as you
    can by playing either the front 9, back 9 or all 18 holes. The Shoot-Out is the
    last game playing mode where four players line up to play three holes. The
    player with the highest score is eliminated at the end of each hole. The first
    and second places receive a cash award.\n
    In PGA Tour 96 for the PlayStation, two professional PGA courses are included.
    They are the SpyGlass Hill Golf Course located on the Monterey Peninsula in
    Pebble Beach, California, and the TPC at River Highlands located in Cromwell,
    Connecticut. Each course has an introductory full motion video explaining both
    the courses history and future.

    Inuyasha: A Feudal Fairy Tale is a 2D fighting game starring characters from
    Rumiko Takahashi's manga and anim? series, Inuyasha. The story centers around
    15-year old high school student Kagome Higure, who inadvertently slips back in
    time to feudal Japan, where she becomes embroiled in a quest to locate shards of
    the Sacred Jewel of the Four Souls. "Feudal Fairy Tale," the game's main mode of
    play, follows this escapade and requires players to engage in a series of
    battles and mini-games in order to obtain the coveted shards. Initially, only
    Kagome and her half-demon companion Inuyasha are playable, but as players
    journey through the game, acquiring shards, more characters become available.\n
    Each character is able to perform both strong and weak attacks, as well as
    throws and counter attacks. Players can also execute more powerful combination
    maneuvers, including special and super attacks, which can only be initiated when
    the Spiritual meter is filled. Additionally, specific attacks can cause
    opponents to drop shards that, once claimed, will fill the Spiritual meter more

    Racing and robots combine in CUBIX-Robots For Everyone: Race'N Robots, a racing
    game based on the animated series and featuring Cubix, Don Don, Maximix and
    other robotic characters from Bubble Town. Players can choose to race against
    other robots in Story Mode or go head to head with up to four players in Versus
    Mode. With typical racing game components like hazards and power-ups, it's a
    race to the finish line on Bubble Town's nine tracks. May the best robot win.\n
    Story Mode tells a Cubix story of the evil Dr. K and unfolds through nine video
    sequences, each followed by a new race. Be the first robot to cross the finish
    line and new tracks will be unlocked and made available for Versus Mode. Points
    are earned by winning a race and can be used to purchase upgrades at the Botties
    Pit. Upgrades include Nitro Scoop for improving agility and Grav-Grip for extra
    traction. New robots become available after a few consecutive wins.
