  Featuring in a children's TV cartoon, The Hurricanes are the most revered team
  in the World Soccer League. The Gorgons are desperate to beat them in a key
  match - so desperate that they have made it hard for the team to even get to the
  stadium. Taking control of one of their star players, you must trek through the
  jungle, mines and a temple to get them to the stadium on time.
  .
  Soccer Kid seems like a logical game to 'influence' a license of a show about
  brilliant football players. Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a
  football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move
  across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.
  .
  In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the player's foot, even while he is
  jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits
  something or is lost. It can be flicked up while you are off the ground.
  .
  The levels move from left to right but on several different vertical levels, and
  there is often more than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to Global
  Gladiators. Power-up tokens can be collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5
  lives takes you back tot he last restart point - losing one of your continues
  takes you to the start of the world.

  health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a
  deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.

game: Red Zone
file: Red Zone (USA, Europe).zip
developer: Time Warner Interactive
publisher: Time Warner Interactive
description:
  Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into
  the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator.
  Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor
  countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special
  operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to
  wage war.
  .
  The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the
  Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm
  cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the
  hostiles from the air, land and sea.  Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition
  depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the
  pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able
  to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike
  series.  Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get
  damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar
  systems become affected.
  .
  Interspersed with the plentiful in-chopper combat, there are numerous
  mission-oriented sequences in which the occupants of the helicopter disembark
  and perform missions on-foot inside of buildings.  Each of the three characters
  have a unique set of weapons, and the player can choose from either of the three
  to use, so long as none of them have been killed during previous on-foot
  missions.
  .
  Red Zone bears many gameplay similarities to the early entries of the Strike
  series of games, though while the first three games of that series had a fixed
  isometric point-of-view, Red Zone has a straight-down POV that rotates along
  with the helicopter.  Red Zone is also highly reminiscent of Zyrinx's earlier
  and similarly technologically advanced Genesis game Sub-Terrania, with the most
  notable similarities being in the relative difficulty of the games, and in the
  manipulation of the Genesis' hardware into providing visual effects not seen in
  other games, such as simulated video.

  of platforms and ladders filled with enemies. Their only method of attack is to
  bash a hole in the ground, wait for an enemy to fall into it, and then bash the
  enemy in the head, which causes the enemy to fall and transform into items and
  delicious food.
  .
  There are five worlds, each with several screens and large boss at the end, as
  well as a minigame between worlds where bonus items can be earned. The game can

description:
  Dragon Ball Z: Buyuu Retsuden (Dragon Ball Z: The Call of Destiny), also
  released in France as Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel du Destin, is a fighting game that
  maintains the dual screen mode previously seen in the DBZ Super Butouden series
  of the SNES, which allowed you to be far from the opponent yet still be able to
  see him by having the screen split between the two characters. This is important
  to note, as the most damaging attack of the game could be just executed from far
  away of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. These special attacks
  also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable)
  to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long
  button combination.
  .
  The constitution of the characters is based strictly on the Freezer and Cell
  sagas (Son Goku SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future Trunks SSJ,
  Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 and Perfect Cell), with special mention to
  Krilin, Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first appearance in a fighting
  game. There are also 9 scenarios available, all of them corresponding to
  recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also appearing for 2 times but in

description:
  European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170),
  and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct
  club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits;
  although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic
  F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic
  green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real
  squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian
  players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as
  Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman
  and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since
  the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords
  were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United
  are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of
  English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based
  in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.

developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, this one is
  based on the 1988 coin-op version produced by Sega. The goal is to place pieces
  made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete
  rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases
  and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of
  the well.
  .
  In addition to a standard endless mode for one or two players, the game also
  includes a "time trial" mode for one or two players, where the goal is to get as
  many points as possible in three minutes. There is also a "doubles" mode, where
  two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling
  their own pieces simultaneously.
  .
  The game offers a number of standard options: setting the starting level, how
  much "garbage" is at the bottom of the well when the game starts, and whether
  the next piece is visible. There are also optional "item blocks," which are
  special flashing pieces that give an extra bonus if they are used to clear a

description:
  Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game set in feudal Japan.
  .
  The background for the game's events is the ongoing battle between noble
  warriors, known as yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the "middle people",
  i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either
  yasha, demonic, or "middle" army.
  .
  The player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as
  well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc.
  occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies
  occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of
  turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses
  commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a
  battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The
  outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength
  of the units.

description:
  We all love those shelled-up Pizza addicts... as do the Russians apparently. An
  all new and somewhat original Mega Drive title starring the Teenage Mutant Ninja
  Turtles has been in circulation recently, flooding the Russian after-market of
  16-bit software. Luckily for gamers elsewhere around the world, the game's ROM
  file has been preserved and since shared online.
  .
  As excited as we were reading about another 16-bit adventure for our
  anthropomorphic turtles, the reality of what we have here is somewhat
  disappointing, although interesting. Similar to the many other Russian releases
  on the Sega Mega Drive, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Legend Returns takes
  elements from other titles without permission - this time from Ubisoft's flash
  game to promote Smash Up, Double Damage.
  .
  Making use of the assets taken from other sources, the Russians have created
  their very own Street of Rage clone (or should we say Hyperstone Heist clone),
  albeit a lacklustre attempt. Gameplay, the repeating scenery and poor enemy AI
  aside, during our initial play-through we encountered an unbeatable Mouser who
  began walking in a bizarre fashion, blocking any further progress.
  .
  Regardless of how well this title handles and whether or not level two can be
  beaten, Mega Drive fans should check out this unofficial offering, whilst
  looking towards the many other original titles Russia has produced for the
  16-bit system over the years.

game: Summer Challenge

developer: Accolade
publisher: Accolade
description:
  The sequel to Winter Challenge, this Summer edition includes 8 events from
  athletics to cycling. The events are:
  .
  1. Kayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate through gates
  without missing or touching them (unlike the real event, there are no reverse
  gates), as well as avoiding to hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward
  paddles, pressing a direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner
  is the one with the fastest time after penalty time is added\n
  2. Archery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows. By moving
  the directional buttons the player moves the erratic crosshair, while pressing a
  button fires the arrow.\n
  3. 400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing the first
  button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the jump either makes
  the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few tenths of second, or goes completely
  off-balance and falls, ending the event\n
  4. High Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player starts by
  setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button to build enough speed.
  Then, just before the jump point the action button must be pressed and held
  until the athlete is in position to pass over the bar. The contest ends once
  there are three misses at an height, or the maximum height is cleared.\n
  5. Equestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the horse to the
  best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls. While a knockdown means a
  time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is
  pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately.\n
  6. Javelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the
  javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few
  steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch
  sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button
  (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is
  released as well\n
  7. Cycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in
  the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge
  without falling.
  .
  Like with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal
  environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or
  compete in a tournament (up to eight human players, with three computer levels
  and 16 nations to choose from). It's also possible to replay and even store your
  best (or worst) moments.

  The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing
  parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter
  captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front,
  and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you
  to shoot them with your shotgun.
  .
  Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of
  them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these
  towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to
  a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your
  enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to
  your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.

  versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller
  skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX.  The surfing event is ranked by judges,
  which give a score to help the players improve their routine.
  .
  The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller
  skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.

  once all the targets have been destroyed a large boss enemy appears which must
  also be destroyed. You are equipped with a standard cannon, as well as a more
  powerful blaster that will actually push your machine backwards with the recoil.
  There are also assist pickups which will follow you and reflect any shots you
  fire at it toward the nearest enemies.

  Phantasy Star II Text Adventures were a series of eight text adventure
  videogames available to users of Sega Meganet, a modem for the Sega Mega Drive
  in Japan, and later released as part of two compilations on the Sega Mega-CD.
  Each of the games takes place shortly before Phantasy Star II, documenting the

  Solar System.

  robots work. He built many small devices and knows how to hack computers.

developer: SEGA

description:
  Based on the character developed by Belgian cartoon artist Franquin, this
  platform features the player controlling Marsupilami, a strange animal with a
  large tail, who was poached along with Bonelli the Elephant from the Palombian
  jungle by Bring M. Backalive and sold to a Circus. Seizing the opportunity when
  the animal trainer fell asleep, Marsupilami got the key using his long tail and
  released all animals, and with the help of their Palombian friends Noé, Bip and
  Sarah tries to return to Palombia.
  .
  While it might seem a typical platform game at first sight, it  includes a
  twist: Instead of dozens of enemies, Marsupilami has to guide Bonelli through
  gaps and other obstacles (not much different than the Earthworm Jim levels where
  Jim has to steer Peter Puppy to safety), by shaping his tail intro stairs,
  bridges or an umbrella, but to do so, he must first collect an icon with the
  abilities required to complete the level, up to four on each. Always available
  is the ability to shape into a giant fist not only to swat guards and other
  enemies away, but also to change Bonelli's direction. The player also collects
  fruits along the way, which not only provide extra points at the end of the
  level, but can be dropped out to slow down Bonelli. Each level is timed, so the
  player can't make many mistakes, even if some time bonus items are occasionally
  available.

description:
  Megapanel is a tile-based puzzle game that plays like a mixture of Tetris Attack
  and a traditional sliding tile puzzle. Blocks rise from the bottom of a well,
  and the player must slide them around in order to create a row or column of
  three same-color blocks. This causes the group to clear, and potentially create
  chains from the blocks above falling. As the game continues, the number of
  blocks that must be cleared to continue as well as the speed at which the stack
  rises will both increase.
  .
  The game includes three modes. First is training mode which explains the basics
  of the game. In this mode, a certain number of blocks must be cleared to
  complete the stage. Second is a "pin-up" mode for one player, where clearing
  blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime girl, the goal being to uncover
  the entire picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where players compete to
  clear their blocks the fastest, and can send garbage blocks to their opponent
  and fill up their field. The game includes two difficulty settings, two versus
  modes, a sound test, and a unique mode that displays the entire game in sepia

developer: Koei
publisher: Koei
description:
  In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the
  nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would
  often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming
  the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious
  Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the
  role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.
  .
  Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in
  different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three
  Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a
  larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is
  rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and
  IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game.
  The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes
  increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.
  .
  During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands
  from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying
  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe
  & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the
  defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each
  player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move,
  bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them
  into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of
  enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

description:
  A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The
  evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to
  steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time
  Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the
  special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix
  the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.
  .
  Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight
  upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually
  drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of
  electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked
  up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.
  .
  There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up
  is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and
  as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone,
  which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is
  focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each
  Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then
  moves on to the next High Speed Zone.
  .
  The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High
  Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being

description:
  The Algo star system is in troubled times...
  .
  Many thousands of years ago, the Algo Star System was a peaceful system. Three
  planets surrounded the peaceful Algo star and were in perfect harmony: Palma, a
  lush green planet, where its citizens devoted their lives to arts and the
  sciences. Motavia, a desert planet, inhabited by humans and native Motavians,
  and the enigmatic Dezolis, a harsh ice planet, where the citizens were just as
  unknown as the planet itself. Unfortunately, the harmony and balance was not to
  last. Palma had exploded, and with it, 90% of the population of Algo died.
  Motavia had fallen into horrible conditions from the explosion, turning almost
  into a total wasteland. The Darkness spread its hand over the land...
  .
  Now, 1,000 years had passed. Motavia had healed somewhat, and life was beginning
  to return to the way it once was thousands of years ago. The Hunter's Guild on
  Motavia helped to keep things steady. But now, a dark evil once thought to be
  long dead is beginning to stir once again, and the young Hunter, Chaz, is about
  to begin his ultimate adventure - and all of it started with one simple routine
  assignment...
  .
  The gameplay of the fourth entry in the  Phantasy Star is similar to that of the
  second installment, sharing notable features such as the ability to equip two
  weapons at once, different healing items for humans and androids, most of the
  "techniques" (equivalent to magic spells in comparable games), etc. As before,
  leveling up and technique-learning is automatic. There are a few segments in the
  game with vehicle combat, which mostly follows the same turn-based formula as
  the regular battles. Side quests are present in form of hunter assignments for
  Chaz and his friends.

developer: Namco
publisher: Namco
description:
  In the land of Coni, its inhabitants lived in harmony. At its center lies a
  mountain called "Peace", in which an amusement park known as "Marvel Land"
  resides. This park is well-protected by the Fairies. Later, King Mole became
  rule of the under dwellers and sent his minions to take over Marvel Land,
  imprisoning the Fairies inside crystal balls.
  .
  A young lad named Talmit is called upon to rescue Wondra the princess, and free
  the Fairies from King Mole. Marvel Land consists of five worlds with seven
  stages each, and the game plays in platform style, in which you need to run
  through the level, killing enemies, and find the exit door. More often than not,
  you have to go through a bullseye to reach it. If you hit the bullseye at its
  center, you are awarded more points than you do by hitting it above or below.
  .
  You kill enemies by either jumping on their heads or attacking them with clones,
  which trail your movement unless you use them to attack enemies or collect food.
  The clones have a limited life and disappear one by one as you use them.
  .
  During the game, you can open any treasure chests that you may find along the
  way, and release power-ups which include boots that make you increase your
  speed, dragon wings that enable you to jump higher and giving you the ability to
  glide to a soft landing, and giving you the use of the "clone" attack. Hidden
  throughout the sections are warp doors that can either take your backwards or
  forwards, anywhere within the park. Each section of a world has you riding a
  roller coaster, in which you must stay on the cars while avoiding signs and
  enemies.
  .
  The last section of each world has Talmit going through the castle to reach the
  end-of-world boss. Unlike other platform games where you must defeat bosses with
  weapons, you are challenged to various mini-games starting from "rock, paper,
  scissors" through to the Musical Chairs variant. If you win one of the
  mini-games, you are able to free one of the Fairies, and obtain a crystal ball
  that you need to defeat King Mole. You then proceed to the Bonus Stage where you
  must collect shooting stars for points. If you lose a mini-game, you are
  transported back to the start of the last section.

  fuel and the enemies on the radar, are shown in the cockpit HUD. The craft is
  able to move left and right, and use a boost to do sideways rolls or complete
  loops to get behind enemies. Some shots can be taken, leading to body damage,
  but incoming missiles are usually fatal and those need to be shot or avoided.

  Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing, as the name implies, is a boxing game featuring
  the three-time World Heavyweight Champion. The game display 2D sprite-drawn
  boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called "FreeCam" 3D system), with the boxers moving
  around the ring in 360°.
  .
  One or two players can choose the number of rounds (up to 15), the round length
  (up to 5 minutes), the number of times a fighter must be taken down to be T.K.O.
  and the number of referee counts (up to 10). There are two game modes:
  exhibition (which can be played against the computer or one-on-one by two
  players) and the tournament mode (single player). Players can choose among nine
  fictional fighters plus Muhammad Ali himself.
  .
  There are two control types: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the
  d-pad moves the boxer around, while the A button is used for jabs, the B button
  for defense and the C button for hard punches. In this mode, the game decides
  which of the boxer's arms will be used for each punch. In the simulation mode,
  the d-pad moves the player around. By holding the A button (for the left arm) or
  C button (for the right arm), the player can perform head jabs (by pressing up
  in the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body hooks (by pressing left) and
  body hooks (by pressing right). Holding the B button, the player can cover up
  (by pressing up), duck (by pressing down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway
  right (by pressing right). By pressing A and B together, the boxer performs an
  uppercut.
  .
  Each fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they get tired by fighting or get
  hurt, the bars decrease. The lower the bars, the slower or weaker the punches
  get, until the boxer is knocked down. By defending himself a boxer can regain
  power or speed. There's also a counter of punches landed at each side of the
  screen. If the fight ends with no winner, the judges decision is made by those
  numbers alone, regardless of how many times the fighters were taken down during
  the fight.

  .
  Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging
  mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky,
  Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch
  from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

  Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four
  Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and
  Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600,
  progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as
  the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after
  Ms. Pac-Man again.
  .
  Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous
  intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms.
  Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".

description:
  As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take
  on the local baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order.  A turn based game
  with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.
  .
  Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of
  creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian.
  Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner
  opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy
  some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.
  .
  You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of
  enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected
  after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied
  by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two
  level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the
  castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the
  other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no
  matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you
  can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have
  enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.
  .
  There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the
  place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it
  back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in
  the game.
  .
  As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and
  demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go.
  But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with
  almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left
  without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid
  him as every week the population increases.

  essentially a jigsaw puzzle.  Next, she must jump from rock to rock to get to
  the other side of the park where she can go on a nature hike.  In the next
  segment, players aim a camera cursor at animals as Barbie walks along the path
  and hit the action button to take photos.  This requires good reaction time.
  .
  There's a ranch in Texas where Barbie can ride horses.  The horse runs on its
  own.  The player pushes the action button to make it jump.  There are numerous
  gates on the course and the player must time jumps correctly to clear them.  If
  they hit too many, they must start over.  There is also the option to play
  horseshoes.  The cursor moves about erratically and you must press the action
  button when it passes over the stake.

  In Florida, Barbie can play volleyball against Midge.  This game allows both
  players to play simultaneously in two-player mode.  Barbie and Midge can move
  forward or backward on the court and hit action to set the ball.  First one to
  ten points wins.  There is also a diving segment where barbies must navigate an

description:
  Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed)
  international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and
  strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament,
  playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one
  of them must be completed in one sitting.
  .
  The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key
  aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight
  (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be
  deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are
  slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and
  momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also
  included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a
  lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes
  from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.
  .
  Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D
  effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted
  down to show more of the field.

  Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to
  pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level
  boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and

  cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed & health
  upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

  You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles
  of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely
  horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a
  hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it
  quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.
  .
  Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street
  Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you
  progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner

  A long time ago, evil descended upon the peaceful people of Hydlide. Old legends
  tell of a lone brave hero who saved Hydlide from the imminent threat of doom -
  the evil demon Varalys. Since then, the people of Hydlide have lived through
  centuries of peace. But one dark evening, a huge column of fire exploded out of
  the depths of Hydlide. The next morning, strange doors began to appear from
  nowhere. Many who were curious entered these doors, but were never seen again.
  From that day on, unusual events and disasters began to take place. Huge cracks
  opened in the ground, scarring the beautiful lands, floods wiped out entire
  villages. And then the monsters came. The Hydlide council feared that the same
  evil in the legends was back again. A wise old oracle predicted the second
  coming of evil. He also spoke of a young man who could save Hydlide from the
  grave danger. This young man is you...

  Super Hydlide continues the tradition of action RPGs started with the original

  Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, you use melee or long-ranged
  weapons or cast magic spells in real time. There is an internal clock in the

  strength. You also have to eat from time to time, otherwise your hit points will

  gameplay of Soko-Ban Hiroyuki Imabayashi wrote for Thinking Rabbit. The player
  controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the
  title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a
  lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.
  .
  The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of
  the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened
  up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round,
  Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them
  into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct
  many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is
  possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of
  the number of steps taken.

  "race" is made up of two heats of two parts each, and hits or kills on the other

  choosing your team's colors and members, you must then purchase upgrades for
  each person: engines, fuel, AI, armor, and of course weapons. During the game,
  you can switch freely between each member of your team. Your vehicle
  automatically moves forward around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and
  brake in order to move closer to or escape from the other team.

  so you can use say water on the one and fire on the other. The rings are also
  different in strength which further adds some complexity.

  established an order of the six Guilds. The world entered the era of prosperity.
  But the evil demon Void stole the Rod of Creation and drove the world to chaos

  Power was broken during the battle. It was divided into eleven rings, known as
  the Rings of Power. The young sorcerer Buc is now sent on a quest to retrieve

  "Rings of Power" is quite different from traditional console RPGs gameplay-wise,

  any storyline except the main quest for the eleven rings. You can talk to NPCs
  about many topics, choose whom to fight, bribe people, etc. There is a day/night
  cycle which affects the behavior of characters. Unlike most RPGs, there are no
  weapons and armor in this game. The turn-based combat is entirely dependent on

  PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and
  technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic
  courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are
  in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of
  the console allow).
  .
  The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were
  digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive,
  driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match
  and Shootout), as well as a replay.
  .
  Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to
  start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's
  possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and
  pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a
  bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit
  areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in
  pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However,
  only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice
  levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.

  mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different
  buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and
  hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving
  (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of
  platform game and shoot-em-up.
  .
  The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is
  a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D
  capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling
  effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.

  The sequel to Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The game concept is still the same,
  though they did improve a lot of features that one may consider 'disturbing'
  from RTK I (e.g. Generals dying easily due to disease, etc.). RTK can be said to
  be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time
  length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to
  build up their forces without much interference. The RTK II gameplay and
  interface is closely similar to Nobunaga's Ambition II.

game: The New Zealand Story

developer: Taito
publisher: Taito
description:
  One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be
  kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black
  market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe,
  managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other
  kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations
  that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook.
  .
  If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear
  and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait
  Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own
  choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties
  that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To
  defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More
  often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of
  fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get
  other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters
  will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots,
  bombs, and fireballs.
  .
  In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and
  the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that
  gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes
  underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface
  again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to
  squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

  Mulan is an unlicensed action game by some unknown developer for the Sega Mega

  Mulan or the 1998 Disney film of the same name - which it steals art from,
  giving us a potential earliest release date. Some of its music is stolen from
  another unlicensed game, Chuanpu's 1996 Ya Se Chuan Shuo; whether or not the
  rest is also stolen has yet to be determined.

  Interestingly enough, the game has a story screen... in Chinese, English,
  Spanish, Portugese, and Arabic. The stories appear to be identical: during the
  Tang Dynasty, the Hun warlord Tan-Yu led his soldiers to seize the dynasty, and
  Tang conscripts all men to fight the oncoming forces. Hua Mulan, not wanting to
  see her old father fight, goes in to fight for him.

description:
  Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey game based on the 1990 arcade
  game from Williams. Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals than any
  sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for
  wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team's
  goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and
  it is possible to do a "super shot" which is strong enough to send the goalie
  into the net along with the puck.
  .
  Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two
  players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also
  adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a "shot race" mode where
  the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.

  animated film, only this time the player does not control Belle but Beast
  throughout the entire game. It is not a sequel to the first game, as both games
  were released in the same year. This title largely retells the story from
  Beast's perspective. It starts with Beast living in a castle in the dark woods
  with his servants (Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts). A powerful storm hits the
  castle and enchants all animals around it. Initially the beast needs to protect
  the magic rose against the creatures. Soon, Belle and her father Maurice become
  involved, and eventually the villagers who invade the castle.
  .
  The game takes place in Beast's castle and the surrounding woods. Through
  side-scrolling platform gameplay Beast can attack from three different stances
  (crouch, stand up, jump) and unleash a limited amount of roars that stun enemies
  for a short time. After regular levels, a sequence with a boss follows. There
  are also a few mini-games where Beast needs to finish a puzzle and catch
  rosebuds. Certain events are time limited. The game keeps track of the player's
  score, based on defeated enemies and collected treasures. There is an unlimited
  amount of continues and the story is told through static, drawn cut-scenes

  As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly
  tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind
  those earthquakes.
  .
  Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either
  Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's
  universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.
  .
  Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for
  instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The
  task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures
  matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.
  .
  After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with
  the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will
  receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters
  would like to receive that hammer.
  .
  Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie
  access to the last puzzle and character.

  Snake, Rattle 'n Roll is an isometric 3D platformer.  The object of each level

  the scales in the level, and if you're heavy enough, the door will open and you
  can make your way to the exit.

  As with many platform games of its era, Snake, Rattle 'n Roll is incredibly
  difficult.  Foes include Jaws, a monster that's all teeth and will kill you if
  you stay in the water too long, and Bigfoots, which stomp all over the place and
  require multiple tongue lashings to defeat.  Then there's the many types of
  Nibblies, such as Pibblesplats, which hop around and splat into puddles,
  Pibbleboings, which are spring-loaded and jump incredibly high, and Pibblewings,
  which fly high out of reach.

  Two-player mode provides both a co-op and competitive experience: while you are
  both trying to eat more Nibblies than your opponent, if you both stand on the
  level's scale at the same time, both of your weights will be counted and it will
  be possible for you to exit the level more quickly.

  and punching enemies, grabbing items from statues, and fighting a boss at the
  end of each world. In each stage, you can find your robot-egg friend Robegg
  hidden somewhere, who will help you out by acting as a projectile and a shield.
  .
  There are a wide range of different power-up items that can be obtained in the
  game, which will do things like give you temporary invincibility, freeze all the
  enemies for a short time, give you an extra-high jump, or even call in air
  support from a helicopter. At the end of each stage, you can play a game of
  chance to win extra items and lives.
  .
  A heavily modified version of the game was released outside of Japan as
  DEcapAttack. The graphics, sound, story, and many of the stages were changed.

game: NHL '94

developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and
  NHLPA licenses in NHL '94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including
  both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in
  the series.
  .
  Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time
  the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards
  (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new
  animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the
  goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is
  completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or
  "regular season" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all
  new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the
  establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes
  (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no
  offsides).
  .
  While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features
  record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD
  quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the
  PC version released at the same time features complete season action.

  A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a

  viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on
  the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and
  enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the
  finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.

  The version released in Japan has English text and adds trackball support, more

game: Greatest Heavyweights

developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Greatest Heavyweights is a boxing game featuring the ex heavyweight champions
  Evander Holyfield, Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali, Floyd Patterson,
  Rocky Marciano, Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey. Their likeness and real fighting
  style are simulated by the game.
  .
  The game is an enhanced version of Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing, being
  also played in a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handled by
  scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. This time, a 2.5D camera is shown
  at the top of the screen.
  .
  There are three game modes:
  .
  1. Exhibition: one or two players can fight a single match.
  .
  2. Tournament: one player chooses among the eight heavyweight champs available
  in a eight-man tournament against the remaining seven.
  .
  3. Career: one player creates a character who starts as the #30 of the ranking,
  fighting his way up against fictional characters. During character creation,
  players can choose the fighter's color of skin (which now includes some
  unnatural colors such as green and blue), trunks and hair, haircut, size of body
  and stats emphasis (power, speed and stamina). Between matches, career mode
  offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats. After
  reaching the #1 in the ranking, the player will be challenged by each one of the
  eight greatest heavyweight champions.
  .
  During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso
  damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become
  gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters
  becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes
  some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked
  down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks,
  fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their
  sides.
  .
  Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can
  be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their
  opponents. Each one of the heavyweight champions has his own set of personal
  taunts. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start
  to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep punching
  each other on a regular basis.
  .
  The game plays sensibly faster than Evander Holyfield's, and the character
  animation is more detailed. There's a replay feature included, and the fights
  are announced by Michael Buffer's voice.

  Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a
  high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast
  as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you
  gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your
  direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass...
  .
  The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is
  longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to
  perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so
  on.
  .
  Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your
  crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck,
  or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose
  several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again.

  deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories,
  from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.

  Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player
  for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face
  each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player
  with a CPU team-mate.

  The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for
  substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which

  Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes
  four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:
  .
  1. "Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to
  a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.
  .
  Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when
  picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy,
  monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other
  players to the ground.
  .
  "Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.
  .
  "Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and
  challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra
  players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher
  CPU difficulty level.

  European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170),

  club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits;
  although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic
  F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic
  green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real
  squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian
  players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as
  Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman
  and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since
  the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords
  were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United
  are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of
  English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based
  in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.

description:
  Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing is a boxing simulation.  Holyfield is the
  only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach
  like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, the developers went for a more strategic sim. The
  game is played from a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handle by
  scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. A top down camera is shown at the
  top of the screen.
  .
  Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the
  Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 30-boxer ranking
  list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can
  choose the fighter's color of skin, trunks and hair, haircut, dominant hand and
  stats emphasis. Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign
  the boxer to improve his stats.
  .
  During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso
  damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become
  gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters
  becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes
  some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked
  down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks,
  fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their
  sides.
  .
  Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can
  be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their
  opponents. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will
  start to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep
  punching each other on a regular basis.

  24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure
  crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other
  parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars
  (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards -
  perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single
  races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a

  Japanese drums during the game and a remix of the umpire voices to a techno tune
  at the main menu. There is no way to view any advanced statistics other than at
  the end of the game in the Japanese version (i.e., errors and hits). All the
  players names are written in hiragana, with English letters being used only to
  show field position and the status of the player.

  Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II is a special cartridge used for, as
  the name suggests, the second Blockbuster World Video Game Championships, held
  in branches of Blockbuster. It was built by Acclaim for North American Sega Mega
  Drive units, and contains watered down versions of NBA Jam Tournament Edition
  and Judge Dredd.
  .
  The event was organised in 1995, splitting contestants into categories - those
  aged under and including 13, and those aged 14 or above. Players could pick
  between Sega's console or Nintendo's SNES (which had a different cartridge - one
  produced by Rare featuring Donkey Kong Country). Each Blockbuster store in North
  America ran the event between June 14 and July 9, producing "store champions"
  who would then progress to further round in August, set at GamePro's
  headquarters in San Francisco. Despite the name it was not actually a "world
  championship".

  A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early
  90s with his "Image is everything" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and
  colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes eight players (male and female and
  as as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to movement speed
  and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand.
  .
  Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all
  kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise
  positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court,
  swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on
  the head.\n
  Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth,
  Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according
  to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a "Skins" game, where each
  point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.

game: Herzog Zwei

developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  The premise is that two opposing forces are in combat with one another. Each
  player controls a jet airplane which zooms across the screen and may turn into a
  ground based soldier. These ground soldiers can hurt enemy units, but can not
  affect bases. To take over bases scattered across the map (and ultimately, the
  enemy base), players must purchase new units and transport them to certain
  positions. In this way, the player acts more like a transport and management for
  different types of units rather than a combat character themselves. If the plane
  is ever destroyed, it restarts at the player's base location. As previously
  mentioned, a level is complete when either side's base is lost to the opposing
  forces.

  As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter
  based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through
  future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human
  resistance.
  .
  Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate
  (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers
  in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage.
  Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the
  machine guns, and are shot to be collected.
  .
  T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general
  concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns
  down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a
  besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy
  supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time
  to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet
  research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend
  off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.
  .
  Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold
  Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final
  battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns

  Ship is an unreleased Sega Mega Drive game by Technopop. The source code of a
  very early prototype was unearthed by drx of Hidden-Palace.org on 24 September
  2007 as part of a development kit for GEMS,implying that the game may have been
  a mere demonstration of the sound driver; if not, development did not progress
  much further before it was cancelled.
  .
  The game is very simple in design. The player controls a ship similar to the one
  in Asteroids. B accelerates while the Left and Right allow the ship to turn.
  When held down, A activates a shield, and C allows the ship to fire. Ships are
  manipulated by the gravitational pull of a star in the centre of the screen, and
  if a ship touches this star, it will be destroyed.
  .
  The game defaults to two-players with five lives each. There is a one-player
  mode in the prototype, however as there are no on-screen enemies the only thing
  that can occur is death. There are no sounds and the graphics are minimal,
  however numerous physics and gameplay features can be altered via the options

developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the
  role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A.
  Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a
  linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very
  well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs,
  crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion
  and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with
  normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil
  slicks and stray cows.
  .
  By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with
  which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit
  something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus
  your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it
  is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.
  .
  Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no
  intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode,
  this is not simultaneous.

  but devoid of enemies or obstacles. The player can switch between "human" and
  "frog" form with A. B presumably attacks (although there is nothing to attack)
  and C jumps. While in frog form the player can jump higher at the expense of
  speed. B can also be held, Super Mario Bros.-style to make the character run,
  although the speed increase is fairly minimal.

  It is impossible to win or lose. The player is not affected by what is assumed
  to be bottomless pits, nor is there any way to complete the level. There is also
  no sound.

  so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one
  exaggerating the effect.

  points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes,
  causing damage to everyone around.
  .
  Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from
  his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time
  limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses
  health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or
  offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player
  can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn
  ends.
  .
  There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is
  affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others
  include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and
  girders.
  .
  There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land

  Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only
  platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare
  appearances in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was
  released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses
  an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also
  left and right. While visiting Flicky Island, Sonic notices that the Flickies,
  his small, feathered friends that can travel between parallel worlds, were
  captured and turned into badniks (the robot enemies of Sonic) by Dr. Robotnik in
  his never-ending quest for the Chaos Emeralds. Seven levels separate Sonic from
  the final showdown with Robotnik. Gameplay is much slower when compared to other
  games in the series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each
  section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its
  insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an
  interdimensional ring. While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level
  with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue
  tokens. Unlike all other previous games, time isn't a requirement: if the player
  completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no
  time bonus at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first
  must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.

  fighters simply to reach the castle, and then you have to climb the various
  sections of the castle, before battling with its existing inhabitant.
  .
  The bulk of the game is side-scrolling platform hack 'n' slash action, with
  mines to avoid on the route. You can collect a number of spells, and select them
  using the function keys. Your physical and mental energy are measured separately
  throughout the game, and must both be kept high.

game: Top Fighter 2000 MK VIII

developer: X BOY
publisher: X BOY
description:
  Top Fighter 2000 MK VIII is a fighting game created for the Mega Drive,
  presumably in the year 2000 by an unknown company. It features 8 characters from
  many different places and sources, including real-life personalities such as
  Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali.
  .
  This is a fighting game with 8 opponents and no repeats between them. Each
  character has their own special moves and one super move, along with 8
  backgrounds that are not character specific. The backgrounds are cobbled
  together using elements of backgrounds found in several different games,
  including World Heroes, Street Fighter II, The King of Fighters '95, and Fatal
  Fury 2. The controls appear to be somewhat better than other Mega Drive pirated
  fighting games, such as Tekken 3 Special. However, the A button is unused,
  leaving B and C to be used for all attacks, similar to a NES fighting pirate.
  .
  Each fight lasts until one fighter wins 1 or 3 rounds and each round can last
  for up to 30, 60 or 99 seconds, depending on the settings. The hit detection is
  poor, with many attacks that miss the opponent when they're supposed to hit
  them. The endings are minimal, with a portrait of your character on a simple
  "YOU ARE BEST. GAME OVER" (sic) screen.

  When held down, A activates a shield, and C allows the ship to fire. Ships are
  manipulated by the gravitational pull of a star in the centre of the screen, and
  if a ship touches this star, it will be destroyed.

  The game defaults to two-players with five lives each. There is a one-player
  mode in the prototype, however as there are no on-screen enemies the only thing
  that can occur is death. There are no sounds and the graphics are minimal,
  however numerous physics and gameplay features can be altered via the options

  Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher,
  run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is

  Squeak's back.

  In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections
  taking place underwater – completing these earns bonuses.

description:
  Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks
  in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3
  same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3
  or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5
  count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The
  real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so
  as to create other lines.
  .
  As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim
  is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of
  bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of
  complete rows which are already in place.

  The Algo star system is in troubled times...
  .
  Many thousands of years ago, the Algo Star System was a peaceful system. Three
  planets surrounded the peaceful Algo star and were in perfect harmony: Palma, a
  lush green planet, where its citizens devoted their lives to arts and the
  sciences. Motavia, a desert planet, inhabited by humans and native Motavians,
  and the enigmatic Dezolis, a harsh ice planet, where the citizens were just as
  unknown as the planet itself. Unfortunately, the harmony and balance was not to
  last. Palma had exploded, and with it, 90% of the population of Algo died.
  Motavia had fallen into horrible conditions from the explosion, turning almost
  into a total wasteland. The Darkness spread its hand over the land...
  .
  Now, 1,000 years had passed. Motavia had healed somewhat, and life was beginning
  to return to the way it once was thousands of years ago. The Hunter's Guild on
  Motavia helped to keep things steady. But now, a dark evil once thought to be
  long dead is beginning to stir once again, and the young Hunter, Chaz, is about
  to begin his ultimate adventure - and all of it started with one simple routine
  assignment...
  .
  The gameplay of the fourth entry in the  Phantasy Star is similar to that of the
  second installment, sharing notable features such as the ability to equip two
  weapons at once, different healing items for humans and androids, most of the
  "techniques" (equivalent to magic spells in comparable games), etc. As before,
  leveling up and technique-learning is automatic. There are a few segments in the
  game with vehicle combat, which mostly follows the same turn-based formula as
  the regular battles. Side quests are present in form of hunter assignments for
  Chaz and his friends.

  damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the
  different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive
  orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in
  combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which
  is only possible if your current mission requires it).
  .
  Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew
  members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew
  members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members,
  Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away
  missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team
  member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected
  character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat
  and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings
  and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.
  .
  Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy
  ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields
  and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you
  can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.
  .
  While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same games, there are
  some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster
  during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it
  takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences
  and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version
  as well.

  you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn
  blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when
  they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which
  will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now
  has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned
  this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!

description:
  The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world
  governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a
  dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in
  football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual
  presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts
  introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a
  market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.
  .
  Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in
  each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how
  good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides
  can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer
  operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges
  quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set
  pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and
  then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be
  selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these
  combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders,
  midfielders and strikers cover.

  This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle racing arcade game.  In this
  game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track
  within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not
  important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a
  different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are
  senior, and Europe is expert.
  .
  This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in
  2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are
  steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your
  speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off

  Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team
  Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their
  fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and
  challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of
  which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who
  progresses.
  .
  You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They
  consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and
  frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and
  tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or
  freeze the opponents.
  .
  The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the
  ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can
  sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars
  which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier
  activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the
  same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the
  stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the
  pitch, in the direction it was going.
  .
  You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear
  on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either
  on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better
  ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved
  to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use
  of them is important.
  .
  A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your
  team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

description:
  A one on one fighting game seen from an isometric perspective. All beasts or
  dragons have two basic attacks: a punch and a tail attack, as well as a special
  attack that can only be performed while a certain icon is displayed. During
  close combat, pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in a throwing or
  choking attack. There is no visible health bar, but three icons are displayed at
  the bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked down for a longer moment, one
  icon turns red. Once all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle arena is
  surrounded by an electric fence, that opponents can be thrown into and which can
  also be used to initiate jump attacks.
  .
  There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. Match is a single match for
  one or two players, where several different dragons are available. Tournament
  sees the player starting out with a week dragon who has to fight increasingly
  difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, Speed and Stamina).  After
  every other battle, a shop can be visited that offers different items including
  food that increases Power, Speed or Stamina, Data Disks that contain information
  on other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, Dragons can be trained. The
  training consists of simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At a few

  NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, was one of the first real playable

  A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play - players jumped
  many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human
  capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or
  violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player
  was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the
  game had an "on fire" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row,
  he would become "on fire" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and
  increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had
  scored four consecutive baskets while "on fire").

  Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five
  different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that
  stands without a ruler  after the master wizard's death. You can play in two
  campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on
  all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the
  next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human
  players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which
  monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you
  have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus
  conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to
  do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your
  monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters
  can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are
  physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain
  types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a
  preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two
  30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not
  only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you
  control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.

description:
  The game is based on the Disney TV series of the same name. Bonkers is a bob-cat
  police officer. One day, he reads in a newspaper that a contest for the best
  policeman is announced. Since his partner is away, Bonkers decides that would be

  thieves who are trying to steal valuable things. In the second one, you try to
  lock a criminal in a yard by quickly building a brick wall around him. In the
  third one, you must find clothes hidden in crates before a bomb explodes.
  Finally, the fourth and last game involves you driving a car from top-down view,
  chasing a criminal. Each mini-game also features a unique bonus game, which you

game: Road Rash 3

developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  Following the previous two Road Rash games, the player has conquered the US
  illegal motorcycle championship. But why settle for that when one can take over
  the World; racing in the peaceful streets of the UK, dodging the animals in
  Kenya, blaze through the night in Japan or jump in the hilly circuits in Italy?
  .
  Keeping the same spirit of the previous two games, Road Rash 3 adds all new
  digitized sprites (based on the 32-bit remake released an year earlier), bike
  upgrades, more weapons and meaner police. Most other aspects of the game remain
  unchanged: the player starts on the lowest division with a small amount of cash
  and a slow, hard to handle bike. To get more money (and get a faster bike) the
  player must beat as many of the other 15 racers to the finish line, using all
  means possible, even kicking and punching them into knockout. By clearing
  (finishing on the top three spots) all five races on a level, the player
  advances to the next, where opponents are faster and tougher, the police is more
  active and a longer race.
  .
  As for new gameplay elements in the final title in the series released for
  Sega's 16-bit console, bikes can also be improved by choosing cheaper upgrades
  (instead of simply buying new ones) such as tires (less skidding), engine
  (improves acceleration and top speed), suspension (allows better control while
  landing after jumps) and body (bike takes more hits before turning into smoking
  metal). Instead on relying on simple motorbike patrols, the police now has
  helicopters at their disposal (which try to land on the player) and patrol cars,
  which attempt to block the path of the bike, forcing it to stop or collide to
  get a bust. To make things easier (or harder), new weapons were added, some of
  which allow the carrier to stun an opponent for a few seconds, making him the
  perfect victim for an incoming vehicle. Also new, if the player finishes the
  race with a weapon, carries it to the next race.
  .
  Each track has it's own features: in the UK, cars drive left on a rainy day, in
  Australia and Kenya animals wander into the road, in Brazil bikers can get
  themselves a close-encounter with a car on a crossing, in Italy the hills allow
  a lot of air-time for light and speedy bikes, Germany, where the icy roads and
  sharp turns make a deadly combination and finally in Japan the race goes during
  the night under the neon lights.

  STORY\n
  The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British
  Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise
  taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the
  New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the
  Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New
  World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists.
  This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts
  the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).
  .
  GAMEPLAY\n
  Choosing Sides\n
  In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American Revolutionary War, either as
  the "rebels" - the American Continental Army or as the "Crown" - the British
  Royal Army.
  .
  Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you to choose the leading
  Commander-in-Chief:
  .
  The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or George Washington.\n
  The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage or William Howe.
  .
  Revolutionary Politics\n
  Each turn you will have to balance your treasury for the war effort. Money is
  provided by each state. The more states that support your cause, the more money
  will flow in your coffers. Money is spent in paying wages, strengthening the
  fleet and recruiting new regiments.
  .
  Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also command your Navy officer to
  "control the seas" which is conducting a blockade and privateering against enemy
  ships. This may result in seized goods that will be added to your treasury.
  .
  The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death included everyone except the
  American Indians: [1] Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not yet
  fully supportive of Continental Army (not under your full control) [2] Loyalist
  Militia: Militia supportive to the Crown [3] French Army: The French will
  support the American cause after a formal alliance is held. [4] Spanish Army:
  The Spaniards will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held.
  .
  Revolutionary Combat\n
  The Top-down turned based combat introduces units available in the Revolutionary
  War: Infantry, Guerrilla, Cavalry and Artillery (Engineers). Combat near shores

  "Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense
  of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was
  hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for
  yearly revisions of the concept.
  .
  There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of
  other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the
  time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents
  and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and
  systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.
  .
  The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game
  even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system
  .
  FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown
  players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and
  Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to
  match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can
  also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World
  Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can
  create your own dream team through the custom team creator.

  Show do Milhão (One Million Show, in English) is basically a quiz game, with 16
  questions divided in three blocks of five questions each, plus the one million
  question. Each question has 4 alternative answers, of which just one is right.
  The player wins a money prize for each right question. If he decides to stop at

  if he guesses wrong, he looses all the money he has won during the game. If he

  new features, such as a reworked graphics engine with parallax scrolling, new
  shots and aftertouch controls, with an Indoor court joins the previously
  available Grass, Clay and Hard courts.
  .
  Changes to the game go well beyond the graphics - now the ball reacts
  differently in each court and it's harder to control the direction of the ball,
  meaning the powerful forehands that could win a game in minutes of the first
  game are much harder to pull. Services now must be perfectly weighted in both
  power, direction and timing, facing the risk of hitting the net or going off
  bounds, with a speedometer showing how fast the best serves went. All these are
  controlled using the three buttons of the gamepad and the d-pad, with the A
  button for lobbing the ball, B to make passing shots and C to dive for a
  direction. By combining the B and A or C buttons it's possible to add top/back
  or full spin to the ball, with the  Y axis changing the power and the X axis the
  direction.
  .
  The large roster of Pete Sampras Tennis was replaced by only eight players: Pete
  Sampras himself, Sam Nimitz (German, powerful player best suited for hard
  courts), Marie Guyennot (French, accurate and fast around the court), Minori
  Hurosawa (Japanese, fast and agile all around), Dino Turnetti (Italian, with an
  aggressive style of play), Wanda Tucker (American, all around), Esperanza
  Delgado (Spanish, powerful serve and volleying abilities) and Richard Potter
  (English, rookie all-arounder).  There are three game modes to square things up
  - Challenge (single match, pairs or doubles on any court), Tournament ("Party
  mode" for up to eight players) and World Tour (single player mode, where the
  player squares against seven computer players, with the option to play singles
  or doubles. There's a Pro mode which extend the match to three sets and increase
  the difficulty setting by enhancing  computer player AI and allowing them to

game: General Chaos
file: General Chaos (USA, Europe).zip
developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  General Chaos is an arcade-style squad RTS where the player controls a team of
  five soldiers in a limited battleground, in a classic Red (General Havoc,
  headquarters in Viceria) vs Blue (General Chaos, in Moronica) all out war. The
  goal of the game is to push the frontline to the enemy headquarters, by winning
  individual battles and then beat them in their own capital.
  .
  There are five kinds of soldiers, each with their weapon of choice and range of
  attack: the Gunner (machine gun, medium range and wide arc), Launcher (rocket
  launcher, long range), Chucker (grenades that can be thrown over barricades),
  Scorcher (flame-thrower, close combat) and Blaster (dynamite sticks, close
  range). Before each battle, players can choose the composition of their team
  from one out of four choices: Assault team, Brute Force, Commandos (a team of
  just two soldiers which have different controls) and Demolition.
  .
  Gameplay is simple to learn, with the A button being used to fire at the nearest
  enemy, B to move to a the pointer location and C to cycle through soldiers.
  Using the commando team changes the controls, with the directional pad
  controlling a soldier directly, with B being used to call the other soldier
  nearby. While basic commands are simple, the player must deal with things such
  as distance from target and angle of attack to succeed.\n
  If two opposing soldiers face-off during battle, they engage in a brawl
  (indicated by a cloud of dust). When that happens, the battle stops and the
  players are in direct control of the soldiers: A punches, B kicks and C blocks.
  Every downed soldier can can be rescued if there are enough medics available,
  earned at the end of each battle depending on how well the player did.
  .
  Up to four players can play, cooperatively or against each other.

  Sorcerer's Kingdom is a mix of RPG and strategy game. You play a young
  adventurer, who is sent out by the king to find out the reason for the
  increasing number of monsters that threaten the land and restore peace to the
  kingdom. Starting out as an Adventurer you are eventually given higher titles by
  the king, as a reward for completing quests.

  turn-based battle starts immediately without taking you to a separate fighting
  area, and you have to fight all enemies that were visible the moment the battle

game: Lemmings 2 : The Tribes
file: Lemmings 2 - The Tribes (USA).zip
developer: Psygnosis
publisher: Psygnosis
description:
  The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant
  plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their
  own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus
  and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10
  levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman
  from the 12 pieces.
  .
  Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in
  use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is
  perhaps the best option for first-time players.
  .
  The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards)
  and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to
  produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various
  methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who
  can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their
  exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any
  combination of skills and experiment.
  .
  Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible,
  rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60
  Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe -
  Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the
  hope of saving more Lems.
  .
  Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you
  have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your
  progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

  You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To
  win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the
  vermin who worship that other god.
  .
  Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the
  wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To
  get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to
  build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be,
  so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing
  the same.
  .
  When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a
  hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength
  from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he
  gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will
  burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.
  .
  But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other
  tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering
  powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their
  best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who
  didn't build on high-ground.
  .
  And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just
  never done.

  First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet
  (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army).
  The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which
  can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its
  own surprises.
  .
  Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use
  whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go
  to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can
  freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.
  .
  Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for
  better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put
  protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser
  turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will
  build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.
  .
  Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to
  dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area
  you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll
  start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level
  up then the at previous level.
  .
  If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush
  the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what
  its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same
  level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy
  soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.
  .
  The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and
  lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your
  men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes...
  to dominate the world and crush your opponents.
  .
  You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your
  men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of
  age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.

  Get ready to put your blue skin-tight tights on. Ninjas need beating-up, bosses
  need clobbering! This game is not so much a platform game as it is a fighting
  game (think Streets of Rage). You run around the levels avoiding sharp flying
  objects and fighting any enemies that get in your way, including the numerous
  bosses. If your in a tight spot you can\n
  call Arthur to help defeat any enemies that are on-screen. The game is presented
  in a normal 2D platformer view when you're just jumping from building to
  building, but changes to a semi-isometric view when you start fighting. You'll
  probably like it if you like Streets of Rage.

  gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.
  .
  You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can

  which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing.
  You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to
  activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different
  amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.

description:
  Fighting Edition follows the same rules and format of most 2D fighting games
  released at the time: the player's objective is to defeat their opponent in a
  best two-out-of-three match using their character's standard and special moves.
  The player has four basic attack buttons (two punch buttons and two weapon
  buttons) and a set of command-based special moves unique to each character. The
  player can grab and throw their opponent like other fighting games, but if two
  characters attempt to do this at the same time, they will wrestle each other
  until one overpowers the other. Below each character's vitality gauge is a power
  gauge that automatically fills up and resets during battle. If the player
  performs a special move at the exact moment the gauge is filled, their power
  level will increase by one level, allowing the player to perform stronger
  attacks. If the player manages to increase their power level a third time, the
  gauge will be temporarily replaced by a thunderbolt symbol, allowing the player
  to perform a super move during this period.
  .
  There are three game modes in Fighting Edition: a Story Mode where the player
  fights against the computer in a series of story-based matches; a Fighting Mode,
  where the player against another player or the computer (or have two computer
  opponents fight each other); and a Trial Mode where a single player must defeat
  as many opponents as possible without losing.

  Time Killers is a one-on-one versus beat-em-up with gameplay in a similar vein

  What is primarily different is that you can attack with all body parts - the

  fighters can keep going with only legs and the head. A special feature allows
  the characters to perform a decapitation manoeuver called a 'death move'

  opponent, and subsequently ending the round. The game features cartoon-like
  over-the-top blood and gore violence.

  There are eight selectable characters, and each one has unique weapons and
  attributes pertaining to the period in time they are from, e.g. Thugg is a

  1496, Orion is an intergalactic bounty hunter with an electro-sword from 2885

  Water Margin: The Tale of Winds and Clouds, also known as Shui Hu Feng Yun
  Zhuan, is an unlicensed beat 'em up game for the Sega Genesis that was
  originally released in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong markets in 1996. The game is
  based off the classical Chinese novel of the same name and was heavily inspired
  by the likes of classic arcade beat 'em ups such as Golden Axe and Knights of
  the Round as one or two players can choose between one of three outlaw warriors
  as they battle against armies of enemies with medieval weaponry and collect
  items to cast powerful magic attacks. In 2015, Piko Interactive has published an
  official English localization of the game for Sega Genesis and later re-released
  the game through Steam in 2019.

description:
  Linus had crash landed on a distant planet called Earth, and made his way back
  home again. Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered!
  Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some
  pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure
  and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and
  talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select
  actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts
  used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the
  action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade
  dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once
  you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you
  decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password
  allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.

  which will dispel the ghost -- and reach the exit without either trapping or
  crushing himself with the blocks.

  routes.\n
  A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at
  any point to continue your game.\n

  Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent
  Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic
  rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and
  jumps with ease. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal
  friends and trapped them inside robots. Sonic can free his friends by destroying
  the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control
  the all-powerful chaos emeralds and Sonic must grab them before he does in the
  3D rotating bonus levels. Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping,
  Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels Sonic
  collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's
  carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back
  before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies.
  Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility
  bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. The game is divided
  into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each
  zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. Sonic the Hedgehog is a
  significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established
  the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."

  Menacer 6-Game Cartridge was released as a pack-in cartridge for the Menacer
  light gun. It is a compilation of six games:
  .
  1. Pest Control: in this game the player has to defend a pizza from the attack
  of assorted bugs. The player smokes the bugs while controlling a spotlight, but
  it is also possible to see the whole table while pressing a second button (in
  this case, it won't be possible to use the insecticide). The game is over when
  the pizza is all eaten. Different bugs will appear throughout the levels, such
  as some big ones which explode in smaller ones when shot.
  .
  2. Space Station Defender: the player has to shoot aliens inside pods which
  appear on the screen in a given sequence and in specific positions. As the
  player follows the pattern, he has to reload the weapon by aiming the lower end
  of the screen where "power" can be read. There's also a random mode, where all
  pods appear at the same time and the player has to guess the order in which
  they'll open. The aliens shoot back if the player takes much time to shoot them.
  Once in a while a little flying saucer will cross the screen; shooting it will
  give the player a shield point. The game is over when player's life is depleted.
  .
  3. Ready, Aim, Tomatoes!: this game is set in Toejam & Earl's universe. As the
  screen scrolls right, Toejam has to shoot tomatoes at enemies such as the Cupid,
  the Dentist, the Boogie Man, the little Devil and so on. There are also special
  items to shoot, like bombs which will kill all enemies at the screen or tomato
  baskets which will give ammunition. For each level there's a target score to
  achieve. In advanced levels the enemies will shoot back. The game is over when
  Toejam's life is depleted.
  .
  4. Whack Ball: this is some sort of a Breakout game. The player controls a
  paddle and has to bounce a ball against a frame of blocks. Once a block is
  touched by the ball, its color is changed, and the objective is to change all
  blocks colors. Some glowing blocks have special effects when hit like sticking
  the ball to the paddle, giving an extra ball or shrinking the paddle. A time
  limit is given to each leval, and if the player doesn't succeed, another chance
  is given. The game is over when all balls are lost though the holes in the
  frame.
  .
  5. Front Line: in this game the player has to shoot tanks, trucks, planes and
  helicopters before they shoot back. There are two weapons available: a cannon
  with unlimited ammo and 10 missiles per stage.
  .
  6. Rockman's Zone: in this game the player has to shoot cardboard pictures of
  bandits while avoiding shooting pictures of women, children and policemen. Bonus
  points are given for acurracy.
  .
  In the shooting games the player can choose to have the Accu-Sight on or off. If
  it is on, a crosshair will be displayed. If it's off, the player can also choose
  to use the Menacer's Binocular Module.

developer: Funcom

description:
  Christmas is a time where people get together and give others presents and spend
  all day eating food. But there's only one problem this year. You see, while
  Santa was sleeping in his bed, the cold and evil snowman spooked all the elves
  away, and the Timekeeper has stolen Santa's plans from his house. There won't be
  any Christmas if Santa doesn't stop them.
  .
  In Daze Before Christmas, you're Santa. According to the game's Christmas
  calender, you have 24 areas to explore such as factories, workshops, caves, and
  more. Each area is filled with nasty enemies like penguins, jack-in-the-boxes,
  helicopters, snowmen, and many others. Furthermore, after every five areas,
  Santa has to come face-to-face with not only The Evil Snowman, The Timekeeper,
  and Louse the Mouse,  but also Mr. Weather.
  .
  Santa's health is represented by five Santa hats. When Santa is hit by any one
  of his enemies, one hat is lost. If Santa loses all of his hats, then he will
  lose a life. He will then have to restart at the beginning of the area, unless
  he passes a gold bell somewhere in the area. When you explore each area, Santa
  can collect presents that contain a mini-Santa (aka: Extra Life), a red hat, or
  he may release an elf. Santa should be careful when opening these presents as
  some of them may contain bombs or other enemies. If Santa manages to find a
  spinning star, he must get it as this will take him to the next area.
  .
  Santa kills his enemies by throwing magic at them. In almost each area, Santa
  can get a cup of hot cocoa. Doing this will transform him into Anti-Santa, a
  type of Santa who wears nothing but white, grows Satan's horns on top of his
  head, is invincible, and comes equipped with a hammer in which he can use to
  bonk enemies with. The Anti-Santa business only lasts for 20 seconds, but this
  can be changed via the Options menu.
  .
  Daze acts like one of those platform games where you run through the level,
  shoot at enemies, and proceed to the exit. However, there are some areas where
  the gameplay changes, and these areas involve Santa flying through the sky in
  England, Russia, Japan, and the USA, and dropping presents in chimneys to score
  points. The game also uses a password-saving system, where entering a password
  given will allow gamers to restart at the beginning of a specific area, in case
  they happen to run out of lives.

  Sega even had a third project running, this time for the Mega Drive. Once again,
  the development was done by a third party. This time it seems to have been the
  mostly unknown developer called Opus, as in-game art and the sound engine used
  indicate. This game was never released, probably due to quality issues, but a
  beta copy was leaked and can be played on emulators nowadays. The game would
  have tried to build on the concept of the original arcade game, but feels to
  some degree more like a very bad approach to the Streets of Rage school of
  beat-em-ups. It is obvious that it either was in a rather early development
  stage, or Sega did right to pull the plug on this botched mess.
  .
  The game features a lot of cut scenes, all of them in the finest Engrish. The
  chapter titles are in Japanese, though. The story doesn't make any sense, at
  least not in its presented state. Later in the game, you meet people you should
  know but don't, and about halfway through the game you get to know that your
  goal from the beginning was to rescue Ryu's kidnapped lady friend.

  the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy
  passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must
  defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it.
  You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.

  He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a
  ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife
  descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.\n
  As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at
  the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors
  took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge
  his father and redemption would be hard.

  Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit
  computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax
  scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic
  cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing
  between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate
  through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and
  activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a
  sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump
  and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just
  one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also
  traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump,
  duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit
  points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level
  (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to
  the difficulty level.

  they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards
  of the Crystal and return home.
  .
  A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive
  Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect
  all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  There is a larger emphasis on
  exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them),
  so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with
  a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be
  obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario
  (ropes, or vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, improper contact
  with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is
  lost and the player must restart the level. Once all lives are lost, the game is
  over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small
  Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages
  there's a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end
  of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as
  possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills
  the meter, a 1-up is awarded.

  .
  If the player chooses the cards help, he must pick one of three shuffled cards
  (K, A, 2 and 3), each one corresponding to the amount of wrong choices that will
  be removed from the screen (the K meaning no removal at all).
  .
  If the player chooses the other (in this case, simulated) players help, a screen
  showing the percentage of players guessing each answer will appear (in the real
  game show, many players participated each night, taking their turns at the
  central place).
  .
  If the player chooses the guests help, three guests will take their guesses on
  the answer, and you can go by their guesses or not (on the real game show, those
  guests were college students).

  The game features the digitized voice of Silvio Santos, as well as the show's
  main theme. All the text is in Portuguese.

  Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games
  held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the
  console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles,
  pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and
  archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics,
  or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events,
  and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow
  competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.
  .
  Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes
  compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two
  qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction
  can earn world record times.
  .
  Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely
  pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then
  set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests,
  three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex
  pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and
  good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round
  composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where
  they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition
  continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.
  .
  The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping
  events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed
  by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight
  allowed three more attempts.
  .
  Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the
  goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of
  the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to
  the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards
  and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed
  directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal
  is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for
  each.

  .
  There are ten levels in the game in which you will face aerial, aquatic, and
  ground enemies. They all fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to knock
  you from the sky.
  .
  In between levels, your plane will land on a runway for refueling and
  maintenance.  You will receive bonus points for the number of bombs left in your
  hold and the number of lightning bolt icons you picked up in the prior level.
  .
  There are also many power-ups available in each level.  Slow-moving blimps
  contain a power-up icon which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes.  Other
  icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed.  These
  power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with
  your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.
  .
  The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot.  As power-ups are obtained
  the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16.  The Wide Shot is a
  comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy
  down.

  If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their
  natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing
  miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain
  found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the
  sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.
  .
  These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track
  painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you
  racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well,
  with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of
  you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to
  avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.
  .
  Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one
  player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting
  your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you
  should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after
  every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within
  your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a
  time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.
  .
  The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4
  points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car
  off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which
  involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level,
  although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared
  the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks
  are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system
  as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

  ducking abilities, and attack timing. Yuko can jump very high and attack while
  jumping. Various power-ups are scattered through the game, many of which enhance
  the performance of Yuko's sword. Acting as a melee weapon in the beginning, it
  can be customized with power-ups and turn into a medium-range weapon, firing
  shots at the enemies - with proper power-ups, also in different directions. Boss
  enemies typically have different attack patterns and require different

  played in the race.\n
  A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in
  the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must
  be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a
  disqualification.

  Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform

  The game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals,
  percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced
  separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like
  the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets
  (present in the PC version only).

  Math Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien
  at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the

  series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games)
  strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately,
  for practice or for score.
  .
  The activities are as follows:

  1. Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the
  tractor beam to collect space trash.
  .
  2. Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around
  columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash
  you collected into fuel.
  .
  3. Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a
  number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each
  side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling
  from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are
  also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels,
  monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.
  .
  4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship displays an equation, and the four
  portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the
  correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship.
  Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs
  where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time
  limit.
  .
  Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate
  that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a

  Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his

  The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump
  over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height
  and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy,
  but the second harms  him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at
  the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic
  torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or
  morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph
  into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to
  overcome some sections of the levels.

  Lion King 3 is a platform game released for the Sega Mega Drive based, not the
  Disney film of the same name, but the original film itself, as a follow-up to
  The Lion King II. It was developed by an unknown company likely connected to
  Chuanpu & Gamtec and published by X Boy.\n
  A second release does not credit X Boy but it is unknown if it was published by
  another company or by X Boy without their logo.
  .
  In this game, players get the choice of playing as either Simba or Mufasa,
  although they play identically to one another, through several levels, each with
  a boss at the end, all while having to contend with various platforming hazards
  such as floating platforms, swings and all sorts of enemies that obstruct their
  path.\n
  Both lions possess the ability to attack with their claws using the B button and
  can fire a special attack, a energy wave that shoots straight forward, with the
  A button. Extra special attacks can be found throughout every level.
  .
  Health can be restored in game by picking up hearts and lives can be gained by
  picking up a 1-up. Atop of this, a life is earnt by picking up 100 Sun Emblems
  with the counter resetting afterwards. Throughout each level, progress can be
  saved by leaping at an unlit torch, which will light and act as a Checkpoint.
  .
  There is no story in-game and the ending screen is simply a shot of the player's
  lion gazing out across a lake as the word "FIN" appears overhead.
  .
  Trivia\n
  Strangely enough, Simba's in-game sprite is coloured a pale pink. Atop of this,
  while his idle graphics are taken from The Lion King, every other sprite seems
  to be an original.\n
  On the same note, Mufasa' sprite is simply Adult Simba's from the same game.\n
  Even more so then with Mulan, this game takes almost every resource from other
  games, such as enemies from Donkey Kong Country and the background on the Stage
  Screen screen is from the Transylvania stage in QuackShot.\n
  Most bizarrely of all, this game contains many sound samples taken from games
  like The Lion King and Disney's Aladdin often distorted immensely and employed
  in appropriate places. For example, a bug will sound like a monkey and the sound
  effect played when you pause the game is a portion of Mufasa's sound bite from
  The Lion King, slowed down incredibly and cut off. It merely says: "Everything
  the".

  Welcome to 2050, chummer.
  .
  Shadowrun is an action RPG of epic proportions. You take on the role of Joshua,
  a Shadowrunner out to discover who murdered his brother.
  .
  Along the way you get into street brawls, deadly gunfights, run the Matrix, slip
  into and out of the MegaCorps, explore the wild wilderness and deal with every
  low-life mage and high-tech cyber Street Samurai in Seattle.
  .
  Shadowrun was based on the FASA RPG of the same name, and while real-time,
  modeled every rule from the paper system, from character stats to experience to
  combat to weapons and equipment.
  .
  The game used an overhead view for physical combat, and a third person "POV"
  when on Matrix runs. It allowed two other characters to join your party either
  temporarily or "for life" however long that may be...

  sphere fell from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles can now push
  forwards, overcoming obstacles and defeating demons.

  "Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two
  paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent
  the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to
  hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You
  advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the
  level boss enemy appears.

  Uchu Senkan Gomorrah (Space Battle Ship Gomorrah) is a horizontally-scrolling
  shooter based on the 1990 coin-op of the same title. The player controls the
  titular ship, Gomorrah, which can shoot both straight forward as in most
  shooting games, as well as freely in any direction via an aiming cursor, which
  is controlled independently of the ship itself. Additionally, there are several
  power-ups that can be found, including speed-ups, additional mounted guns, and
  the life-up, which will not only increase the ship's armor, but also cause it to
  grow in size as well.
  .
  The game features 9 stages, each with a boss at the end, as well as one or
  two-player simultaneous play. The game difficulty has been rebalanced from the
  arcade to compensate for the lack of a trackball to control the aiming cursor;
  the player must stop their ship in order to move the cursor.

  Westwood Studios' real-time strategy classic Dune II received a major overhaul
  when ported to the Sega Genesis. While the basic concept remains the same, the
  game features all-new graphics, streamlined controls, changes to the tech tree
  as well as completely new levels.
  .
  As in the original game, the player controls the troops of one of three noble
  Houses, called by the Emperor to mine the Spice Melange on the planet Arrakis,
  also known as Dune. A series of consecutive battles must be won by mining spice,
  constructing a base and building units to attack the enemy.

  The rather complex menu-based controls of the original game have been replaced
  by a context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit reacts according to what is
  below the cursor - either moving to a destination or attacking an enemy unit,
  for example.
  .
  The tech tree has been simplified: Among other changes, concrete slabs are only
  available in the 4x4 size, there is only one type of vehicle factory and the
  advanced units do not require an IX research center anymore.
  .
  Finally, the progression of levels in the console version is strictly linear, as
  there is no choice of the next map to be played as in the original version.

  Australian Rugby League is the "sequel" of some sorts of Rugby World Cup 95, but
  focusing on Rugby League rather than Union. In addition to the 20-team league
  that names the game and the State of Origin, a competition between two
  selections of players from New South Wales and Queensland, an European League
  (composed by twelve teams) and international playoffs (eight) are also
  available. It is possible to play friendlies, or jump straight to the club
  competition playoffs.
  .
  Gameplay is simple, and focus on quick passing and running rather than kicking
  to gain distance. The A button controls kicks the ball (tackles in defense), B
  passes (or changes players) and C rushes and breaks tackles. There are a few
  additional tricks, such as pressing A+B to perform a short, lobbed kick or A+C
  to clear the ball from the defense. Kicking from a dead ball situation uses a
  three-click method. The first sets the bar in motion, the second the strength,
  and the third the accuracy. The stronger the shot, the less accurate it will be,
  and the initial position of the kicker also affects the direction of the ball.
  Each button represents a different ball height, from A (which is the lowest) to
  C (highest). Weather also affects how the game is played, as high temperatures
  with hard grounds make longer games tougher on the players (slowing them down)
  and cold, wet weather makes passing the ball more difficult.

  Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working
  late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot,
  thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from
  his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up
  to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating
  plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle -
  workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and
  rescue his dad!
  .
  The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the
  player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the
  basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle,
  whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon
  is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at
  them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down
  the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread
  throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special
  skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby
  Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy
  Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.
  .
  Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and
  raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several
  entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the
  Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point
  reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing
  your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies.
  The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely
  missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.

  are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama
  himself.
  .
  Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of
  levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters.
  Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island,
  fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown.
  .
  During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks
  on him/her, or use a "taunt" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle
  lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu);
  once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If
  the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a
  continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent.
  Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different
  depending on the character you have chosen.
  .
  Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the
  opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled
  opponent or another human player.
  .
  The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of
  Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.
  .
  In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new
  one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this
  feature, though.

game: Pyramid Magic III

developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Pyramid Magic III is the final title in the Pyramid Magic series of puzzle
  adventure games, and picks up right where the second game left off. Our hero is
  still inside of the same pyramid, but is finally nearing the treasure he seeks!
  Unfortunately, it would appear that the final step requires a large, heavy,
  fragile jug filled with some kind of liquid. He must now find a way to take this
  jug to where his treasure awaits.
  .
  While the basic concept remains the same, the game is made more difficult by the
  addition of the jug. The jug is fragile: if it is kicked or dropped any
  distance, it will break and the stage must be restarted. However, it is also
  dangerous: much like the stone blocks, if the explorer falls even one square
  while carrying it, he will be crushed by its weight. In each puzzle, the player
  must collect all of the keys to open the door, but he must also reach the door
  while carrying the jug with him in order to proceed. There are a total of 30
  puzzles to solve, and once again the player is allowed to "pass" twice.

game: New Horizons
file: New Horizons (USA).zip
developer: Koei
publisher: Koei
description:
  In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World
  was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of
  exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six
  adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot,
  to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters
  are:
  .
  1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted
  Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him
  into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked
  with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at
  level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and
  eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.
  .
  2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her
  brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to
  a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.
  .
  3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the
  Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts
  the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out
  valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.
  .
  4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he
  yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure
  that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to
  finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the
  world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.
  .
  5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He
  dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign
  lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is
  able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...
  .
  6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the
  service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the
  kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is
  given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet.
  Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in
  the name of King and Country.
  .
  Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down
  sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where
  speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents.
  Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean
  worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a
  port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings,
  each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The
  Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and
  the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and
  financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are
  through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other
  ships.
  .
  During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with
  the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons
  at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the
  player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge
  the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two
  captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose
  which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

  opossum Sparkster can move around, jump and attack with his sword. Using his
  rocket pack, he can also perform stronger attacks and burst through the air in

  gradually, making it possible to perform successive attacks in the air,
  ricocheting off walls. The first meter allows for the strongest attacks, but
  fills more slowly. Sparkster collects diamonds, apples to restore health and
  different types of power-ups for his sword. Most levels have typical platform
  gameplay, but there is also a level where Sparkster walks around in a giant
  robot, knocking enemies out of the air.

  For an additional challenge players can locate the seven swords hidden

  you use a gem at the correct place. The pony would automatically jump over
  obstacles, but you can also make her jump with a corresponding button. You can

description:
  The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.
  .
  Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too
  sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you
  seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of\n
  isometric death await.
  .
  The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by
  encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard.
  To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As
  frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances
  annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what
  challenge lies in the next room.
  .
  The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items;
  you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises
  with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through
  a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The
  dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade
  items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a
  special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he
  executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the
  left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save
  option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you
  like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.

description:
  Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the
  fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of
  protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa
  hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a
  precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord
  Ouks.
  .
  The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based
  combat, somewhat of a cross between  Wizardry and platform games. Despite being
  a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on
  character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party
  of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and
  classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many
  things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development
  of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise
  personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with
  elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.
  .
  The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area.
  Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party
  at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will
  be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are
  unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and
  interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and
  some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to
  open doors.

  cause of justice. He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called
  home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.
  .
  What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced
  scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right,
  forcing players to negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without
  controlling Chelnov's speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above,
  and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies
  that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons
  and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and

  Beggar Prince (Xin Qigai Wangzi) is a Chinese-made RPG loosely based on the
  famous novel by Mark Twain, Prince and the Pauper. A young prince is bored with
  the life in the palace, and one day manages to go outside the gate, distracting
  the guards. In the town he meets a young boy who looks very similar to him. The
  prince offers him to switch their clothes, because he wants to spend the day as
  an ordinary boy. But when he comes back to the palace, the guards don't
  recognize him in his beggar's clothes and refuse to let him in. A new life, full
  of danger and adventures, begins for the young prince...
  .
  The game is conceived in the tradition of Japanese RPGs. You navigate the prince
  on the world map and around towns, fighting random enemies and descending into
  dungeons. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from an isometric
  perspective. You can attack physically or use a variety of magic spells,
  classified in types. In the beginning of you turn you have a full SP bar; each
  action reduces it, and when it is depleted, your turn ends. You can for example
  heal, cast magic, and physically attack different enemies during the same turn.
  Your enemies utilize the same system and can unleash multiple attacks on you.

  commands to the batter, pitcher, and fielders rather than directly controlling

  through splashing water. The player can check the depth and reel in when needed.
  When a fish has been caught, it becomes a sensitive play with the line tension
  to make sure it does not snap shown through the side-view of the fisher. At the
  end of the day the boat can go back to the weighing area to determine the
  results. Money earned in the tournaments can be used to acquire new spin reels,
  bait reels, boats, lines and lures.

description:
  This cartridge combines two different localized flavours of the original arcade
  game. There are two modes, Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers the same levels
  and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.
  .
  In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is
  constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited
  firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking
  bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind
  Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs
  that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five
  takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a
  selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first
  mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much
  slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right
  away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.
  .
  The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options.
  After using a continue, the player immediately receives a "Special" power-up
  granting four wingmen.

  Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.
  .
  Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the
  80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button
  mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the
  action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in
  swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button
  touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially
  faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top
  half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.\n
  Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the
  action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial
  mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the
  action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical
  event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being
  the one with the highest score on all three rounds.
  .
  The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France,
  Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the
  Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of
  athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform
  differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World
  Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The
  competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the
  gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).

  establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes
  (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no
  offsides).

game: Streets of Rage 3

developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Streets of Rage 3 aimed to build on the success of its predecessor, so while the
  style of gameplay and control scheme is largely identical to its predecessors,
  significant changes were made to the overall structure of the game. Streets of
  Rage 3 is a faster paced release with longer levels, a more complex plot (which
  in turn leads to more in-depth scenarios complete with interactive levels and
  multiple endings) and the return of traps such as pits. Dash and dodge moves
  were added to each character's arsenal of moves, and weapons can now only be
  used for a few times before breaking.
  .
  Changes to the fighting mechanics allows for the integration of weapons with
  certain movesets. Team attacks, absent from Streets of Rage 2 but available in
  the original Streets of Rage, make a return, and are occasionally used by
  enemies too. Blitz moves, performed while running, have also been altered and
  are now upgradable over the course of the game (predicated on how many points
  are earned per level). Death causes a downgrade, however holding the X button
  before a series of button combinations can give players access to the upgraded
  moveset at any point in the game, at the expense of the time taken to perform
  attacks.
  .
  Enemies are also smarter with weapons, and some can even steal health upgrades,
  and there are also several secret playable characters, unlockable after
  overcoming certain conditions during the game. Special moves also no longer
  drain the user's health - a separate, automatically regenerating bar is
  introduced for this purpose.

  You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon
  series in this action title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim is to
  complete each course in a particular position, which is achieved either by
  waiting for them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the race, or by
  inflicting that damage yourself. Your car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow
  to impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many hazards the races throw at
  you, including boulders and rabbits, which can be taken out for points.\n

  A.D. 1997, New York City
  .
  Having vanquished the evil crime empire, Neo Zeed, the ninja master Shinobi and
  his combat ninja skills were not heard from for some time. But a new threat
  arose, in a reptilian form that lived on vicious instinct alone. The colossal
  monster moved slowly and quietly, and its attack was relentless. The souls
  unfortunate enough to survive became hostages, and mass panic swept the streets.
  .
  It remained only for Shinobi to take action. His weapons were stealth and
  quickness of attack, his only allies facing overwhelming forces. Relying on
  Ninja weapons and magic, Shinobi fought on, assisted by his faithful dog.
  .
  Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi is similar to Shadow Dancer for home
  computers, and consists of five missions containing three stages each. However,
  there are a few differences between the two. For example, in this Sega
  Genesis/Mega Drive exclusive, the stages are different, and you rescue hostages
  rather than disarm bombs.  Each mission ends up with you fighting a boss, and
  when you defeat each (except the final one), you also participate in a bonus
  stage where you must shoot all ninja flying towards you.
  .
  Some of the enemies are also quite different. Some of the lizards, which appear
  in later missions,  leave a "lizard coin", which you can collect for bonus
  lives.

description:
  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the
  sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog. Players run through different worlds called
  "Zones", each with a specific theme. There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10
  Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik
  controls, which you must defeat to progress. Sonic and Tails can collect rings
  which are scattered throughout all of the levels. When the player collects 100
  rings they earn an extra life. The rings also act as protection - if Sonic is
  hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly
  invincible. If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life. If the
  player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able
  to access the Special Stage. In this stage, you must gather a set amount of
  rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint. Complete all the
  checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds. The game also
  includes the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a
  player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails.
  Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that
  Tails will not hinder play. Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a
  standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a
  "Spin Dash". This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where
  you need some momentum. The game also features a 2-player versus mode. This mode
  is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones
  in the single player game.

game: Tetris

developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, this one is
  based on the 1988 coin-op version produced by Sega. The goal is to place pieces
  made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete
  rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases
  and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of
  the well.
  .
  In addition to a standard endless mode for one or two players, the game also
  includes a "time trial" mode for one or two players, where the goal is to get as
  many points as possible in three minutes. There is also a "doubles" mode, where
  two players work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, each controlling
  their own pieces simultaneously.
  .
  The game offers a number of standard options: setting the starting level, how
  much "garbage" is at the bottom of the well when the game starts, and whether
  the next piece is visible. There are also optional "item blocks," which are
  special flashing pieces that give an extra bonus if they are used to clear a
  line.

game: X-Perts
file: X-Perts (USA).zip
developer: SEGA
publisher: SEGA
description:
  X-Perts was an extension of Sega's Eternal Champions Universe.
  .
  It starred one of EC's fighters (Shadow Yamamoto) in an unique action adventure
  game. She lead a team of elite X-Perts to do impossible missions. The game was a
  mixture of action, adventure and strategy.
  .
  X-Perts was set in an futuristic underwater research lab called AQUA, besieged
  by terrorists. The player controlled 3 characters, each with unique fighting
  moves and specific skill knowledge. All characters and backgrounds were
  pre-rendered in 3D, to give it a very high end graphic look.
  .
  The player had to react to events happening in the lab to progress the game and
  avoid destruction, while battling both the terrorists and the stations defenses.
  .
  This was done by direct and indirect control of the X-Perts through the entire
  lab (roughly 20 different levels.) The player used a special RECOM screen to
  monitor his characters placement across the separate areas of the lab, as well
  as all mission objectives, enemies, facility robots and other hazards.
  .
  Using direct control of a character, you would move around and between levels
  and directly combat enemies. The player could also activate tasks for mission
  objectives. The time it took to complete a task was based on the strength of
  their Engineering and or Computer Science skills.
  .
  Missions were constantly being generated and some were time dependent (missing
  it usually meant the situation got worse for the X-Perts), so hopping between
  X-Perts and assigning the ones with the best skills for the task was important.
  Some secondary missions allowed character upgrades to their personal weapons.
  .
  Characters could also use 3 unique torture moves each to get information from
  the enemies instead of killing them. This would sometimes be needed for mission
  objectives. However, if not executed properly, it would instantly kill the enemy
  instead.
  .
  The game modeled all 20 levels of the lab in real time, so even when you left a
  character to activate another, it would still continue to perform its task until
  it was attacked by enemies, and would automatically defend itself, but to a
  lesser extent then if you directly controlled it.
  .
  The game was broken down into chapters (save points) and each chapter remembered
  the status of the entire lab environment (enemies, flooded areas, broken power
  grids, hacked computers, active forcefields.)

game: George Foreman's KO Boxing
file: George Foreman's KO Boxing (USA).zip
developer: Beam Software
publisher: Beam Software
description:
  Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where
  players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds
  against different boxers to win the championship title belt.
  .
  Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the
  shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming
  punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross,
  but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.
  .
  By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available,
  inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of
  three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over
  (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a
  single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch
  buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an
  energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and
  during intermissions, some energy is restored.
  .
  All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A
  password system is used to save the progress.

game: Alien Storm

developer: SEGA

description:
  The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them
  out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and
  Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.
  .
  When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as.
  There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several
  stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from
  the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens.
  Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get
  tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants,
  postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective
  such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.
  .
  When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot
  to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours
  get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you
  can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see.
  These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of
  the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs
  across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present
  location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will
  then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of
  energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.
  .
  At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to
  complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings
  where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens
  popping up from several locations with the building.
  .
  You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.

game: The Lawnmower Man

developer: Time Warner Interactive
publisher: Time Warner Interactive
description:
  The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself
  loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce
  Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries
  in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of
  primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.
  .
  With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the
  chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation,
  and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he
  notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs
  such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly
  increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the
  experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the
  drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the
  treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take
  revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to
  take over all computers in the world.
  .
  While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both
  cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or
  Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting
  action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after
  collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives
  protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the
  movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.
  .
  The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences
  of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional
  shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual
  World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different
  approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging
  obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to
  Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person
  and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel
  with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).
