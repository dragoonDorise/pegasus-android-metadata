  description:
    Part 2 in the series, Back to Baghdad is a squad-based shooter that picks up
    right where the first Desert Storm left off. John Bradley, Paul Foley, Mick
    Connors, and David Jones are back once again to team up and once again take on
    Saddam's henchmen. Whether it's protecting friendly choppers from enemy fire,
    the burning oil fields, Iraq's chemical weapons program, or secret superguns,
    there was apparently enough unfinished business left to serve as the basis for a
    second game. For the sequel, the developers improved on the team-mate AI and
    game UI, but the biggest appeal is once again the split-screen co-operative
    multiplayer for up to four players.

  description:
    The first game in the Outlaw series of sports titles, Outlaw Golf is what you
    get when you take the classic game of golf and throw in lesbian strippers,
    wannabe rappers, ex cons and other wild personalities.  The game has a bad
    attitude chock full of sexual themes and language that puts Happy Gilmore to
    shame.
    .
    Outlaw Golf pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired
    with equally over-the-top caddies) to compete in over 30 different tour events
    from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and balls as well
    as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games.
    The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when
    you do well, the game is easier and when you aren't doing so well you will find
    your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low? Beat up
    your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost
    composure. Multiplayer supports 8 different game modes, including stroke play,
    match play, skins, best ball and casino with up to four players.

  game: Baten Kaitos Origins
  file: Baten Kaitos Origins.7z
  developer: Nintendo
  publisher: Nintendo
  description:
    Baten Kaitos Origins is a prequel to Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost
    Ocean. Long ago, the evil god Malpercio attempted to destroy the other gods; a
    large battle of the gods ensued, and following this the people of the world were
    forced to flee to various islands floating in the sky. 1000 years after the war
    the people live peacefully in the sky for the most part; but Emperor Olgen, the
    emperor of one of these islands, has begun a plot to gain control of all the
    islands.
    .
    The main character of the story is Sagi, a "Spirit-born" individual who has been
    given a secret mission to assassinate Emperor Olgen. In similar fashion to
    Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, you don't actually control Sagi in the game
    but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game you can give Sagi advice,
    and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten
    all of the islands...
    .
    Gameplay is similar to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and features a card
    based battle system. Many items in the world have a "magna essence"; these items
    can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and
    defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve
    puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you;
    battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to
    use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are
    possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points,
    gold, and will also recover all hit points.
    .
    The battles in the game aren't random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will
    be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In
    addition to the main story line, numerous sub-quests will also become available
    by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a
    useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to
    level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and
    subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have
    the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain
    experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.

    Vertical shoot-em-up ported from the Naomi Arcade version. Ikaruga is more or

    Based on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black & white
    sides of his ship during gameplay.\n
    The black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it consider as bonus, and
    dies on impact with a white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damages white
    enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those
    properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies
    fast.

    This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes

    separately for tournament play outside the game.  Once all the mini-games have
    been purchased, players can add up all of their tickets to total up their

    Midway brings back all the craziness of the Cartoon Network's ED, EDD, N EDDY
    with ED, EDD, N EDDY: MIS-EDVENTURES for the Game Cube. Centering around three
    kids with the same name, MIS-EDVENTURES follows Ed, Edd, and Eddy through yet
    another of their zany adventures. Gamers will control all three kids throughout
    the game, switching between them at any point. Each of the three had their own
    special abilities, and players will need to master each character to get through
    the puzzle-filled levels. Ed is the powerhouse of the team, able to pick up
    large objects and move them out of the way. Edd can operate machinery and can
    make use of different items. Eddy has stealth abilities and is the only
    character who can use stink bombs to get enemies out of the way. Each of the
    three also has an unique team-up move that involved all three characters working
    together. The levels contain the typical insanity often found in the cartoon. On
    the first level, for example, players have to try to sell a number of snow cones
    from their snow cone stand; however, to get the business going, players have to
    steal ice from other characters. There are eight different scams to complete,
    each of which involves Ed, Edd, and Eddy making use of whatever they can find or
    steal. Gamers who love ED, EDD, N EDDY will love stepping into the characters'
    shoes with ED EDD N EDDY: MIS-EDVENTURES.

  description:
    Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi
    driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even
    under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The
    courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and
    pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring
    as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers
    are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare
    they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very
    short.
    .
    In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be
    replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are
    encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra
    tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the
    customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the
    end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a
    personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a
    very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast
    as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to
    perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more
    quickly.
    .
    Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific
    goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible
    to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end
    of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S
    for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade
    version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers
    to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different
    attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and
    Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).

    passes all raises his Agitation Meter, until he is ready to burst and will fight
    at the slightest poke check.

  game: Resident Evil 4

  developer: Capcom
  publisher: Capcom
  description:
    Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series
    follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret
    mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As
    Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind
    everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon
    attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's
    daughter.
    .
    Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a
    fixed third person perspective, the game features a new "behind the back"
    movement camera angle and an "over the shoulder" aiming feature that allows
    players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a
    brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work
    together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them
    to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game.
    .
    The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer
    require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in
    a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and
    weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area,
    and visit the infamous "merchant" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps,
    weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.
    .
    The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the
    original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to
    Resident Evil 2's game A/B system, where the player must play the game through
    the eyes of Ada Wong. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which
    allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even
    Albert Wesker himself.

    .
    Your quest will take you to various places, from strip joints and hotels, to
    office complexes, and even prison... as an inmate.
    .
    Dead To Rights is an action game in every sense of the word.  When fighting, you
    have the opportunity to perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from
    behind and using him as a human shield, to tossing a fire extinguisher and
    shooting it, causing a huge explosion.  When against an enemy and you have no
    gun drawn, you can perform "disarm" moves, which causes your character to steal
    the enemy's gun, then performing some sort of finishes, such as a neck breaker.
    Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as
    your progress.
    .
    A unique addition in this game allows you to control Jack's best friend, and
    partner, Shadow, his K-9 dog.  Using Shadow, you can kill enemies from far away,
    and retrieve their gun in Shadow's jaws.
    .
    Dead To Rights features adrenaline combat, which is similar to that of
    "Bullet-Time" from Max Payne.  You can perform slow-motion dives and spins,

    Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves
    of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used
    to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull's-eye

    precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size
    are now reflected during gameplay in the players' momentum and turning radius.
    To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts.
    .
    With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is
    more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies.
    Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the
    player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes
    and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for "face sculpting" -
    changing the different features.

  description:
    Special forces S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team's helicopter malfunctioned and crashed
    during their mission, disappearing into the Arklay Mountains. This and what
    happens to them is told in the story of Resident Evil Zero. Now, S.T.A.R.S.
    Alpha team is sent on a mission to investigate a series of murders around
    Raccoon Forest. Spotting the Bravo team's helicopter, or what's left of it, they
    land nearby and investigate the surrounding area. Unaware of what they might
    expect, one member is attacked and devoured by zombified dobermans. The rest of
    the team, with a little bit of luck, find shelter in a nearby mansion, not
    knowing it was probably better to stay out.
    .
    You play the entire game with one of the two selectable characters, Chris
    Redfield, or Jill Valentine. The starting point is the lobby of the mansion the
    three surviving S.T.A.R.S. members just stepped in. After a short while, the
    team decides to split and search for any possible survivors or anything useful
    that may help them break out of this dreadful place. To their amazement, they
    encountered an enemy they never were trained to confront, zombies. There is only
    one mission to be considered now: survival.
    .
    The game is largely a remake of the original Resident Evil for the PlayStation,
    with some additions. While the floorplan of the returning locations is almost
    entirely unchanged, several new areas have been added in, extending your stay in
    the mansion. A new enemy, Lisa, has been added to the game, making your trips
    outside of the mansion much more dangerous. Finally killing a zombie is now no
    longer good enough to put them to rest. They must be destroyed totally with fire
    or else they will rise again; faster, deadlier, and madder than before.

  game: Odama
  file: Odama.7z
  developer: Nintendo
  publisher: Nintendo
  description:
    Odama is a quirky pinball title set in ancient Japan.  You are in control of a
    giant steel ball, called the Odama, which you use to crush the enemy army (and
    hopefully not your own soldiers) so that you have an easier time leading the
    Ninten Bell to its destination.
    .
    The game also takes of advantage of the GCN microphone (included with most
    versions of the game), which you use to command your troops. You must use the
    commands and pinball skills to successfully lead the Ninten Bell to its
    destination before sunset in each mission.
    .
    Using the L+R buttons to control the flippers, the X button to activate the
    microphone, and the control stick to tilt the battlefield, the controls in Odama
    are quite simple for today's standards.  In each mission, you, representing the
    Yamanouchi clan, try to bring the clan's powerful treasure, the Ninten Bell, as
    well as the Odama, closer to the Karasuma Keep, headed by the man who betrayed
    the founder of the Yamanouchi clan.  It is there you will exact revenge for his
    betrayal.  Notably, the game features a narrator that talks about the story in
    Japanese, but there are English subtitles.
    .
    The basic goal of each mission is to guide the bell from the bottom to the top
    of the screen, mowing down the members of the opposing army with the Odama, as
    well as killing them with your own soldiers.  It is important that they are
    killed because, if they reach your side of the screen, they will make the
    flippers inactive for a relatively long period of time.  When all Odamas are
    lost or the sun sets, you fail the mission.  In addition, you learn commands for
    your soldiers as you progress through the game.  Using these commands, you'll be
    able to more effectively control your soldiers in many ways.  For example, by
    saying, "press forward," your troops will use all of their strength to try and
    plow through enemy soldiers.  These commands are not only very useful, but in
    many cases, are vital to your success.
    .
    However, use of certain commands and reckless use of the Odama drains your
    Morale Bar.  When this bar is low, your troops will stop responding to your
    commands, which can and will be disastrous to your mission.
    .
    There are also items that the Odama can pick up along the way to aid you.  Most
    notably is one that allows the Odama to convert all members of the opposing army
    over to yours when it rolls them over.
    .
    In merging all of these elements, Odama is a very fast, difficult, and frenzied
    title. Although it is a pinball game at its core, the voice commands, power-ups,
    and storyline throw it into a league of its own.

    up everything in your path to get it back?

    Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal

    graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get
    to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult
    due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.
    .
    To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread
    shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for
    protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and
    choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at
    other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to
    avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill
    them.

    The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses
    removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The

    Game" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all
    the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit.  Included with

    THE LEGEND OF SPYRO: A NEW BEGINNING for the Game Cube. This time, the game
    focuses on Spyro?s childhood and recounts the story of his first major battle
    with Cinder the Dragon. The game begins with Spyro hatching out of an egg and
    being raised by dragonflies. He has no idea that he?s a dragon, but once Spyro
    discovers this, he will have access to many of his dragon talents, including
    fire breathing and flying. He will need all of these abilities to take down the
    evil black dragon Cinder, who is plotting to resurrect an evil force and take
    over the world. A New Beginning focuses more on battle than platforming. Spyro?s
    breath attack can be modified with elemental powers, and each of these four
    elements has three different attacks that Spyro can access once he collects
    enough gems. Each attack has its own uses. In addition to elemental blasts,
    Spyro also has access to one fury move per element. These moves damage enemies
    across the entire screen. The flying levels work just like aerial shooters, with
    Spyro blasting his way through Cinder?s flying forces while dodging and
    spiraling out of the way of incoming blasts. These break up the combat missions
    and, together, turn THE LEGEND OF SPYRO: A NEW BEGINNING into a great game that
    explores Spyro?s past and turns him into the dragon hero everyone loves.

    Chaos Field is a top-down space shooter similar in concept to the Gradius
    series, or Ikaruga. You control one of three ships, each with their own pilot
    and unique weapon systems.
    .
    The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss
    battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of
    boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat.
    .
    The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called "fields", you
    can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you
    increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies.
    Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field,
    you stand to gain substantially more points.

  description:
    When it comes to licensed games based on popular movies, television shows, or
    toys, we - along with the rest of the sane gaming community - know pretty much
    what to expect. The game will borrow from its license, either following the main
    story directly or taking an "other world" approach to it, and offer the licensed
    characters in a tried and true gameplay design. So it should go without saying
    that while Meet the Robinsons is a solid overall attempt at the "movie game"
    sub-genre, there isn't anything that's really going to blow players away.

    Kirby arrives on the Nintendo GameCube at warp speed in his first-ever racing
    game. Based on the same principles as games like Super Smash Brothers and past
    Kirby titles, Kirby Air Ride offers an entirely new approach to the racing
    genre. The ultra-easy controls give Kirby Air Ride instant playability no matter
    how skilled the players may be. You control Kirby with the analog stick and the
    A button -- that's it. The stick steers the character left and right (he
    accelerates perpetually) and the A button when pressed slows him down and when
    released delivers a temporary speed boost. The idea is to hold the button down
    around corners, drift them, and then shoot out with a burst of speed. The game
    features a four-player split-screen mode and LAN support for link-up play.

  description:
    Capcom VS SNK 2 is composed almost entirely of classic Street Fighter and SNK
    fighting techniques, which means lots of charge moves, half and quarter circles,
    and super moves. What's new to the game are the different "grooves," or fighting
    styles. Although the "Capcom" and "SNK" grooves were introduced in a previous
    game, Capcom VS SNK 2 takes this concept a step further by introducing six
    different grooves: C, A, P, S, N, and K. Depending on which groove you choose,
    the type and number of fighting techniques you have available changes, with half
    of the grooves leaning towards traditional Capcom fighting and the other half
    leaning towards SNK-styled battle. The difference between the two fighting
    styles is mainly the availability of certain non-lethal moves such as air
    blocks, dodging, and rolling, with each groove having its own balanced mixture
    of the said moves.

    in actuality is armed to the teeth with various weapons and unique abilities.
    The setup results in an experience that approaches perpetual carnage, and it's

    the character's ability to sneak up behind robot foes equipped with open rear
    data panels and hack into and take control of them. Add to that split-screen
    multiplayer battles, and you've got total robot destruction,

    Mystic Heroes is a fighting game loosely based on the novel Fengshen Yanyi (16th

    ex-emperor Kang and his magical army. The gameplay itself is simple: the player
    wades through enemy hordes and kills them all. He has the choice between eight
    characters which all have different advantages and disadvantages - but basically
    the player chooses between sword and magical attacks. He can also use combo
    attacks.
    .
    During the course of the game the player can find magical runes which give him
    additional magical abilities and power-ups, e.g. health and mana refreshments or
    temporary and permanent improvements to the attacking and defending statistics.
    In fact some of these runes have to be earned by completing the story mode
    multiple times - the player can use the same character for his and gets to keep
    his abilities and statistics. Mana also replenishes with every defeated foe.
    Besides the story there is also a Survival mode.

    aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole
    new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a
    nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick,
    which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to
    play.
    .
    Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and
    Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts
    and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and

    Luigi, while checking his mail, found out he won a mansion in a contest.  What's

    he is, he calls up his brother, Mario, and asks to meet him at the house.

    through the mansion's many rooms, sucking up as many ghosts as he can.

    rooms with the keys you find along the way.  You can also gain special abilities
    for your vacuum, such as the ability to shoot fire, water, or ice.  Remember
    though, treasure is scattered everywhere.  Check all the objects for coins and
    paper money, and who knows, you may just make enough money for Luigi to buy a
    mansion of his own...
    .
    As you explore the strange mansion, the plot slowly unravels and it becomes
    apparent that something more sinister is going on in that haunted house.  Will
    you ever see your lost brother Mario again?

    With the 2002 World Cup Tournament just around the corner, it's no surprise that
    console soccer games are a dime a dozen right now. Since EA's got the official
    World Cup license locked up in the US, other sports game makers are trying their
    best to stand out and convince footie fans that their game is the one to get.
    The lineup is fairly clearly defined: SEGA's games cater to arcade gamers, FIFA
    skews more on the sim side, and Midway's RedCard falls somewhere in between.

    players move through the single player missions, however, they will be given
    tasks other than just hunting down specific game. Some levels require players to
    keep wild animals away from a camp, save lost hikers from grizzly bears, or help
    an injured forest ranger get back to town. One of the most interesting additions
    to the game is the inclusion of slow motion time. Players can slow down time to
    line up that perfect shot. Slow motion time only lasts for a few seconds,
    however, so players still have to be quick on aiming and firing. CABELAS hunting

    Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series
    follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret
    mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As
    Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind
    everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon
    attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's
    daughter.
    .
    Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a
    fixed third person perspective, the game features a new "behind the back"
    movement camera angle and an "over the shoulder" aiming feature that allows
    players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a
    brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work
    together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them
    to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game.
    .
    The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer
    require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in
    a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and
    weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area,
    and visit the infamous "merchant" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps,
    weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.
    .
    The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the
    original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to
    Resident Evil 2's game A/B system, where the player must play the game through
    the eyes of Ada Wong. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which
    allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even
    Albert Wesker himself.

    Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters
    they unwittingly awakened.
    .
    Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to
    her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string
    together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub
    machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard
    any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip
    up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric
    strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in
    order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill,
    eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and
    gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker
    opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game
    progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on
    distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included,

    NHL Hitz Pro is Midway's 2003/2004 entry into the licensed hockey market. For
    the 2004 sports season, Midway introduced a directive to move their sports
    titles away from over-the-top arcade-style gameplay, and introduce a more
    sim-like approach to sports. For NHL Hitz Pro, this meant moving away from
    3-on-3 hockey to 5-on-5 hockey gameplay to make the game more authentic for the
    demands of the sim hockey player. While NHL Hitz Pro still maintains many of the
    arcade-style elements that were a signature feature of the Hitz series such as
    checks over the boards and hits through glass, the gameplay has been tuned to
    provide an experience that is accurate to the sport of hockey. That being said,
    the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced
    arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play.
    .
    As with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and

    race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you
    encounter along the way.  Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then
    gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion.  If you perform enough
    tricks, eventually you can break into "freakout" mode, where you can travel at
    ludicrous speed.

    the movie. Each selected driver has different attributes that effect the
    performance of the car.  If the driver is skilled enough he can enter “The
    Zone”. Once in “The Zone”, the car performs at optimum efficiency.   The point
    of the game is to win the series championship against your arch-rival. The game
    contains an arcade mode, a story mode and a multiplayer mode.

    John Raimi is assigned to infiltrate the Volks Corporation in Southern France.
    This corporation specializes in weapons but has been conducting bizarre
    experiments. John becomes a part of one of those experiments, and his spirit is
    separated from his body. As a ghost, he must possess other beings to find out
    what happened to his body. John has to find his body before it perishes.
    .
    Players start the game as John Raimi in human form. The game plays as though it
    is a regular first-person shooter. Players in human form can strafe, aim, run,
    and shoot enemies. In spirit form, they must possess people or animals to keep
    from being pulled into the afterlife; they can also drain the life from plants.
    To possess a being, first players have to frighten it. Players achieve this by
    possessing objects in the environment and making them do strange things.

    Unlike the first game, however, the sequel is much more open-ended (a la Grand

    and doing everyday tasks from stopping muggers, bank robberies and car-jackers,
    to delivering pizzas and snapping photos for the Daily Bugle.
    .
    However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to
    keep the streets safe in general for the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to
    face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and Calypso, as
    well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off
    against Dr. Octopus and save New York in the process!

    EA Sports takes players back to the field with FIFA SOCCER 06 for the Game Cube.
    Featuring nearly ever soccer team in existence and hundred of players, plus
    tweaks in game play and several new additions. Gamers will first notice the
    slight changes in controlling their teams. The passing and dribbling controls
    have been fine-tuned, allowing gamers to control nearly every aspect of the
    game. Each player has a strength rating that comes into effect when passing, as
    does the amount of weight players put behind the kick. A new shooting method,
    called the Optimized Shot Meter, requires more control and attention, as well.
    All of these realistic details make gamers feel like they're actually in the
    game and in control of everything. Manager mode now requires players to keep
    their club's budgets and handle purchases. Players have to decide how much to
    spend on staff, recruiting, stadium expenses, and other items. Then gamers have
    to decide if they want to sign with a sponsor to bring in extra income. All of
    this adds up to create a game that requires managers to really manage their
    team. FIFA SOCCER 06 contains all of the modes that made the previous FIFA
    SOCCER games great, including season, tournament, shoot-out, and verses modes.
    Voice-over commentary for the 06 version is provided by Clive Tydsley and Andy
    Gray. Soccer fans will enjoy hearing their expert commentary throughout the
    season as they recruit, train, and guide a soccer club to victory in FIFA SOCCER
    06.

    difficult but peaceful lives, until the day the Shadowraith, Dark Yabu, and his
    minions swept down from the sky. With ferocity and ruthless efficiency, they
    descended upon the townfolk, enslaving them to work deep in the caves that
    surrounded their village.
    .
    Dark Yabu murdered the grandfather of the young Vexx, who managed to slip
    quietly aboard the enemy's windship. There, locked deep within Yabu's sanctum,
    was the last pair of Astani Battle-gauntlets. The gauntlets leapt onto Vexx's
    outstretched hands and bonded to his arms giving him special powers. Prepared to
    meet his destiny, Vexx embarks on a quest through volcanic islands, frozen
    citadels and giant castles to confront Dark Yabu, save his people and avenge the
    death of his grandfather.

    course, but to race well you'll have to use another means of replenishment:
    performing tricks with your board. You'll also want to make use of turbulence
    from racers who are in front of you.

    rifles, but only a small amount of clips can be carried. Enemies hardly ever
