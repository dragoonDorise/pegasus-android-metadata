# Some Tips

There are some some tips that can help you manage your collection Better.

- Use CHD format
- Clean your Mame roms
- Scrape your own artwork

## Compress your ROMs

Stop using ISO format for CD systems, you can save tons of space using the CHD/CSO format.

This pack comes with [CHDMAN](https://github.com/CharlesThobe/chdman) and [Maxcso](https://github.com/unknownbrackets/maxcso) to help compress Roms locally on your device.

CSO is for PPSSPP since it doesn't support CHD.

This will take a lot of time depending on your device and the number of ROMs you compress!

Note that for GameCube and Wii ROMs, they can be converted to RVZ within the dolphin app itself. In Dolphin. tap and hold on a game then select "Convert File".

## Clean up your Mame roms

Mame romsets are usually full of clones and roms that we don't want, follow this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZfoOTckURA) to fix that.
